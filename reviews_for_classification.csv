"Not gonna lie- they are not much to look at. Lol. Luckily I’m one of those ppl that values things for function over looks & these function well so far. They are seriously one of the most comfortable pairs of socks I’ve owned in 5 decades.  I have not tried to wash them yet, so fingers crossed on that rn.  They feel very cushiony.  I wear them in my winter boots & just on my feet shoeless around my home.  I wish they came in more colors.  I’m one of those ppl that absolutely cannot stand toe seams on socks, but these have not bothered me at all.  I have super high arches so the only change I would make to the socks would be some compression there.  However, the socks fit perfectly as-is which really surprised me given my arches.  I just like having compression at my arches bc it feels good on them.  I wear a ladies 10-1/2 shoe- mens 8-1/2 and I bought the medium socks. They fit perfectly.  That’s never happened.  I had honestly expected to have to get them wet on my feet & let them shrink to fit (as they dried on my feet to my size) since they are wool. Lol. I also expected to need sock liners as I’ve had issues with wool in the past (allergies- I knit & crochet it), but I’ve not had any issues with itching luckily. Hopefully the allergy is behind me now.  This week in northern Colorado I’ve worn the socks inside my boots in minus 15 degrees & can honestly say my feet were the only warm part of my body while walking my dogs.  Seriously thinking about making mittens out of a pair bc they kept my feet so warm. Lol.  Probably the best $15 I’ve ever spent on Amazon.  These are wonderfully thick & comfy socks.  They aren’t much to look at imo, but far better than the $28 Darn socks I tried before & that was for 1 pair!",0.9982,393,15.72,0.8,2.53946

"I loved this chalk bag online, but in person, not as much - only because it seems more like a man's chalk bag. It is rather large in size and the color seems darker in person. I love prAna products and enjoy their clothing line and headbands, but this definitely seems like a man's chalk bag. So much so that I gifted it to a guy friend and he loves it and uses it all the time. On that note, I will say that the bag is great quality and the design is really unique.

This is a solid product that held up against 40 mph gusts on a beach in the pacific nw for 4 months July-October. If you are in a rainy climate you 100% need a rain screen. I spoke with white duck support a few times. They have an awesome staff but they did not stress the importance of a rain screen. Plus they were sold out of rain flys. All of my camping gear inside of my tent got moldy. my tent itself got moldy. I’m currently soaking it in oxy clean formula per the manufacture instructions. I had a feeling I would need a rain screen but did not prioritize it and now there will probably be some light mold stains on my tent. Overall I would recommend it. This could be a 4 season tent but only w a rain fly in rainy climate.,0.8997,160,14.545454545454543,0.2,1.92991
"I've had my super73 for a week.  I use it to commute in Seattle.  I feel like I left the rat race of traffic.  thats a big deal.  So I'm giving the bike 5 stars.

I live 7 miles from work with big hills.  my s73 can make the trip in roughly the same time as my car.  Its insane.  It is so fun.  granted.. I have the s1, which is the next model up from the z1, I still thought I should review this for my fellow amazonians.  I've had a blast with this thing.

"I ordered one of these a few years ago to replace a worn out connector on an osprey hydraulics bladder and I ordered a second kit recently to make reservoir adaptors for filling or in-line use with a sawyer squeeze (using the blue and grey sawyer 28mm to in line adaptors that came with the squeeze filter). The same adaptors can use used to convert any 28mm soft bottle into a reservoir or refill a reservoir from any 28mm bottle. How fantastic! I love that the female end of the quick connect seals closed when not connected to prevent spills, so you can disconnect it from the male end/the rest of the tube and no water will spill or leak.<br /><br />They seal in very snugly, this is by design. However, you can pull the adaptor out of the house easily after running under warm water. I saw in another review that someone got frustrated because they inserted the adaptor into the wrong length tube and threw out the entire bladder - wow! No need to do that, run it under warm water and pull it out. I think this represents a massive user error and is in no way the fault of the manufacture. You can disconnect and reconnect several times using this method.<br /><br />I have been using Osprey Hydraulics and other Hydrapak products nearly every day over the past 5 years. Other than replacing one worn out part (for $10) I have had no problems at all. They have a lifetime warranty, they are easy to clean (dishwasher or bottle bright tablets), they are filter compatible, and they LAST. I can't recommend these products enough and I use them for running, trail running, hiking, and backpacking in both summer and winter conditions.",0.7398,339,28.25,0.8,2.4619400000000002

"Update... after charging approximately 3 times, now it won't turn on or do anything at all.<br /><br />I chose this one because it was more attractive than most of the others.  It does tell time, and measure heart rate and BP.  The touch screen doesn't work, or works intermittently.  I have to go to the app on my phone and tell it to take my blood pressure.  So, for $50, it might be an adequate, portable blood pressure monitor.  That is what I wanted it for, but I'm not really sure how accurate it is.  I like that you can customize the display.  Upload your own photo, decide what information you want it to show on the face.  The pedometer is not accurate; I can log up to 30 steps while I am sleeping!

"This table is just plain fun. The family has enjoyed it immensely, and this table has taken a lot of use in the past year.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- good build quality for a low price.

Have had many hours of enjoyment... family tournaments, challenges. It really provides some quality family times<br />- stands up to some pretty heavy teenager use, so that is a great testament to the quality of this table.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- the table tennis is smaller than regulation. Nor necessarily a con, and it is still plenty of fun, but we had some trouble playing doubles on it.<br />- table tennis surface lays flat, but there isn't anything to keep it in place. It takes some adjustment to get it straight, and is prone to get out of whack if you bump the table. But this has really been far less of an issue than we initially thought it would be, and you can't beat the price.<br />- the net for the table tennis had to be replaced already, so just expect a 5 dollar cost after about a year.

When I traveled on planes, I typically used a hard case carrier, but it was heavy and something that I would have to try to hide away in the hotel room. This travel bag folds up and stores nicely. I even loved the look of the box it came in (very unique shape). I think this would make a great gift for the golfer in your life!",0.9956,230,19.166666666666668,0.2,2.35868
"Perfect for my 152 lb, 5'8&#34; son, who is an award winning jui-jitsu champion. To be honest, i did get this for myself (I am 5'7 and 145) but since I am not at the quality of form as my son, I figured I would let him try it out. He wore (and washed it) 3 times (before surrendering it back to me) and I can tell you he loves this Venum. Typically he uses other more expensive brands (primarily Podium), so this was the first time he wore anything in the Venum genre. He gave me an honest review, told me it is lightweight, yet strong and not stiff. He actually wanted to keep it, but I told him I technically ordered it for my own use, lol, so he unwillingly gave it back. I am rating this 5 stars as my son is terribly picky when it comes to his gis, so, if he is giving it 5 star, so will I. As a sidenote, I did also use this personally last weekend when I was doing my beginner training and concur entirely with my son (although I do believe this is technically made more for a man than a woman).",0.9782,243,30.375,0.0,2.29346
"These are low-end Callaway balls but you would never know it. First, comes attractively boxed (would make wonderful gift giving for the golfer on your list). Second, they perform (trust in the name, don't just look at the price). I live in Florida (in a golf resort) so these will be getting a lot of use. This morning my husband and I both used them exclusively. Now, I am a novice and my husband not so much (usually will finish 18 holes in the high 70's). We both feel that these balls definitely added distance/yardage to our swings. I would highly recommend these balls as a relatively inexpensive, high quality alternative to high priced golf balls. I would say for every day use, these Warbirds are great and I will be buying two dozen more (one to give my husband for Father's Day).",0.9888,171,19.0,0.0,2.29664
"My grandkids absolutely love this set! I live in Florida (Palm Beach Gardens)). Originally I was planning on them setting this up in my yard, but my son suggested trying it out on the beach (I am about 3 miles away), so we all packed in the car and went. What fun! Super easy to set up and fun to play. We even had two other kids we didn't even know join in for a few rounds. I highly recommend this for a portable take along game (think camping, beaches, etc) as it seems to provide hours of fun for young and old alike! Mostly made of plastic, but it seems pretty durable and I believe it will last for years with reasonable care and use.",0.9919,147,18.375,0.0,2.29757
"Beautifully packaged, this set was an immediate hit with my 7 year old grandson. First, he takes swimming lessons at the clubhouse here in Florida and he couldn't wait to try this on in the pool. Goggles remained clear, did not fog up. Flippers hugged his feet and he was able to breath flawlessly through the snorkel. My son and daughter in law have a trip planned to Nassau in January and they wanted to try snorkeling with him this year, so this came just at the right time! I never liked the idea of renting snorkel equipment anywhere (considering germs and the cleanliness of the items between users). For around $40-45you can get a set made custom for your child that is a far higher quality than anything you would rent at a beach resort or on a cruise and will last years with growth. Would make a great Christmas gift this year for any child in your life!",0.9562,176,22.0,0.0,2.28686

"This Carnahan Forged Wedge is a great wedge for the beginning golfer (like myself) or even my brother who is a regular golfer. We both used this wedge on several rounds of golf over the past few weeks. My brother, who is a Callaway fanatic, was impressed at the wedges weight and fit in his hand. He called it 'old school' feeling and he told me he really liked it for use in sand traps. I myself liked the fact that even though this club has a sturdy feel, it was easy enough for a woman like me to grip and use. I think at an affordable price, I can recommend Carnahan for all golfer levels, but I especially think if you are not looking to spend a ton of money on designer clubs, Carnahan seems to deliver the same quality at a lower cost.",0.9011,160,26.666666666666668,0.0,1.87033
"These balls are not miracle workers (contrary to the product claims). They are an overpriced gadget that would make a unique gift for the golfer in your life (tell them it's the latest technology). Bottom line, I would not spend $15 a golfball for these when I can buy a dozen of ProTitleist balls for $30 and have superior results. Rating these as a three star because they are unique and I know my brother would love these (for bragging rights to his golf buddies).

These are great adjustable ankle weights.  I think you could use them for your wrists too.  I recently injured my knee and am having physical therapy and my pt recommended this type.  Two inserts about  1 1/2 lbs - the packets weigh about 10oz each. They are a bit snug to pull in and then replace.  The inserts are sewn nylon or like material so they are a bit slippery which does help a little bit in removing and inserting. The inserts are a black material and so are the ankle straps.

I purchased these for my daughter to use on a little road trip she and her husband are launching from my house.  They keep food frozen for days in the right cooler.

I added some pics too.  The mesh bag helps to protect the shock pack AND the sharp edges of the shock pack from coming in contact with skin.  Win/win.

I think it is probably safer than his gold band, but he tells me that he's worn it for more 30 years at the same job and he's not going to change it now.  Okee dokee. In all honesty, it is not very attractive in my opinion, but it was functional as ring - if it had fit.  I would recommend sizing down - but if you get one that is too small, it's really not useful either.  I think it's just hard to size a ring without trying it on.

"UPDATE BELOW:  We purchased these for our grandsons visit (5 and 8) - they are terrific.  Fairly easy to put together - no tools necessary as they snap together with pop in nibs - would be easier with two people - but I managed to put them together by myself (I'm 58 and not super athletic). Once together, they feel very sturdy.  They are the perfect size for our little guys and will be for several years.  They have wonderful cloth bags with zippers and elastic bands to secure the pipes and pieces securely.  The bags have heavy duty handles.  They are fairly heavy - but the bags and handles make it easier to lift and move them.  We chose the turquoise - very nice and true turquoise.

"Well.  I have been using this for many months.  I waited to be provide a fair and honest assessment. This is a review of my personal experience.  My main disappointment is the syncing with the fitbit app - I have a samsung android smart phone with the app installed, further - the app is current with all provided updates. The fitbit 3 itself needs to be ""restarted"" multiple times a week- you must attach it to the charging cable, push/hold the side button and hold for up to 10 seconds to force restart.  Otherwise it does NOT sync.  SUPER annoying.  And then there are the times when it randomly decides NOT to record my sleep record.  GRRRR....  I have had multiple fitbits - beginning with their gen one version.  Provides reasonably accurate info - BUT if you must FIGHT to get the info through sync - it sort of looses it appeal.  While it says that it does allow you to swim, so water friendly, I do not soak or submerge the fitbit.  I don't remove it as I wash dishes or my hands - so it has been splashed with water.  When I get in the pool, I take it off.  I just don't trust the water friendly part.  I may go back to my fitbit 2 because it is so much more slim and attractive.  These are somewhat clunky.  I also have tried the much larger watch face version - I quickly stopped using it as it is horribly uncomfortable in size alone - the fitbit 3 is much better than that watch face/square version.  The bands on the fitbit 3 are easy to change.  I have not placed a screen/face protection shields on and haven't had too much trouble with scratching - in fact I don't see any - yet.  So I can't say how easy it is to replace the face - or to place the protection screening on.  I wear my fitbit on one wrist during the day and change it to the other wrist at night while sleeping - I use an alcohol wipe to clean the back of the unit and band several times a week. Further I don't wear it one or two nights a week to give my skin a break and to charge it.  I did purchase the perforated (holes in the band) to provide more breathability.

I purchased 2... one for my 4 year old and one for my seven year old.  Both fit perfectly.  They are thick... do their job... They kept the boys warm while the water is a bit chilly (Oregon coast).  I think these will last a couple of summers before they are too small.  The zipper is quite substantial and works easily. You want to be sure you are completely dry when you put them on.  That way the slide a bit easier.  I know some folks use baby powder but we are avoiding inhaling that as both boys have asthma.  They peel off fairly well... and hose off nicely.  The colors are bright... easy to see.  I will say that our 7 year old wasn't too thrilled with the &#34;stiffer&#34; action (hindering his wave running) but the 4 year old loved not being cold.  We did not purchase water socks.. but if you're super concerned I am sure they are available.  No more blue lips and chattering teeth!

Also... on the lowest white light setting... doesn't hold for more than about 4-5 hours.  Meh.

"Ok.  I am not a total neat freak, but I do LOVE this thing.  I have looked at these for years and after packing for my last trip, I finally just fell off and bought it.  It works just as advertised and another reviewer, &#34;top 500 reviewer&#34; did a very useful video with her review.  I didn't get my folder for free, but I am still going to sing it's praises.  It really does save space to have everything folded in the same way. I travel a lot and I am using it to pack and of course when doing laundry.  After a try or two, I got into a rhythm and it was a dream.  Just remember to place shirts face down first and center them... and then fold up the bottom if they are longer than the folder. Perfect every time.  Pants are good too, just remember that they need to be the width of the bottom, center folder. Also, folding on a surface that is a good height for you is key.  I have bed that is up on feet about 4&#34; taller and so it hits me about mid thigh.  Plus it's a queen size bed.  I just pile my folding on one side and begin. My bed has the right amount of space and is the right height for me, not too much bending and you can easily see what you've got.  I have found that it works best with cotton items... chiffon, floaty, poly- you know, slippery stuff is a bit tricky and takes a bit of practice, but I've even mastered that.  My husband is a husky dude - 4x.  This folds big guy tshirts and others easily. Using the same principles you will learn from practice with regular size stuff, it's truly a breeze and LOVE how all of his shirts are all folded the same way now. Saves space and is neat and tidy without any more effort than normal manual folding.  Haven't tried the towel fold yet, but I will.  Give me time.  I'm still jumping up and down about all the clothing I can fold now! I am admiring the neat and tidy stack of clothing for my next trip as I write this.  Now, being honest, I am going to report that the &#34;hinge&#34; parts are most likely going to give out after a period of use... but as another reviewer noted, gorilla tape will correct this when it occurs. I have some of that stuff.  I will do that because frankly I will never give this thing up.  Other than what I have reported, I don't think I can add anything else.

"I am posting a ""reserved"" review...After the experience buying the black one for my husband and the first one arrived, opened and not working!  (BAD Amazon order fufillers sending an obviously opened and non-functioning product)  I have had my Shine for about a week... I wear in on my wrist most of the time.. I chose to remove it before bathing.  If I were swimming I would leave it on, although the propoganda states that if you wear in ""treated"" water it reduce it's life - odd to me.  Also, it doesn't auto sync.  You must sync it to your phone each day.  The upside is that you don't have to charge it, just replace the battery.  It seems to be fairly accurate.  I will update if there are any use/wear issues.  It arrived quickly (I have prime) and in good condition.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/15/2014..... So... I've been using the Shine for about a month... it hasn't failed, to my knowledge. It syncs when prompted to, although I have found sometimes it takes longer than others even though I set it right next to my phone each time.  It has survived one system ""update"" without noticeable issues. I chose to remove it when bathing. I do wish it auto synced rather than to manually prompt it to do so every morning.  I have learned that if you are interested in following your sleep pattern one night at a time (it doesn't provide a graph of experience, however you can review night by night - would be nice to have an over all view), you must use the wrist band.  Using the magnetic clip does not provide sleep info. Also note: when using the magnetic clip, be aware that it is HIGHLY likely to detach from you and attach to something else magnetic if it gets close and you may not even notice that you've left your Shine on something else.  The ""watch"" band seems to be very durable. The time option of the Shine is interesting and maybe entertaining for a short while, however, it is not as ""obvious"" as you might think.  It is very easy to misread. I found myself double-checking my phone a lot because I would think... hmm... my Shine says 5:30 but I KNOW it's 6:30. I eventually chose to ""turn off"" the watch function.  Which is another thing.. to change anything you must be attached to where ever you downloaded the progam, not an option on the Shine itself.  All of this is just information for those of you who are researching options.  Honestly, the best part of the Shine for me is the battery and not having to charge it each night or every few nights. I didn't think I would mind the wrist band, but I am bored with it and it's look now, which sometimes interfers with my jewelry options. I considered the necklace accessory, however, the reviews of it were overwhelming not so great, so I stuck with the wrist band and the clip that comes with it. Over all it seems to fairly accurately record movement. However, when this one fails, I am probably going to search out the next option unless they do the subtle upgrades mentioned above... but even then, I think I'm still looking for the device that works best for me.  Hope this info helps you in your research!<br />UPDATE: NOV 18 2014.... Sooo...about 2 months in and now it sometimes doesn't sync the sleep info. Randomly it just fails. And it would be nice if it would provide a graph or chart or some analysis of your sleep and workout info... but nope.  It does now sync with My fitness pal, which is a free easy way of keeping track of your food/calories. Honestly, it's still disappointing because there are so many others that offer you more for about the same amount of money.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/4/2014.... Ok... the shine has officially stopped syncing... it's been ""sputtering""... not recording data... taking a really long time to sync... etc.. I tried replacing the battery just in case.  So... in less than 3 months.. it has stopped working. I would NOT recommend this pedometer at all. You would like to think it work for at least a year!  I have the first gen fit bit... I just wanted one I could wear on my wrist.  Honestly, I think I will try the wrist model of the fitbit.",0.9895,884,20.09090909090909,0.1,0.72685

"I have a left leg amputation. My brother died and I got his older Schwin Airdyn Comp- an old model. I use my arms mostly so wanted to do HIIT training using my arms. I also have low back pain, and the seat was extremely uncomfortable (as it is on most air bikes). I contacted Schwin several times to see I they had any other seats available, and no reponse. Dont hold your breath waiting on customer service. I am a bodybuider, so am familiar with hard workouts. The Schwin gives you a great, hard (as hard as you want) workout. Trouble was, the handle bars broke at the junction where the handlebar connects to the bike/fan area. The only way to fix this was to take that area completely apart and insert a new axle. This would have been a major hassle,and possibly required some welding. Forget about getting someone to come to fix it. Needless to say, after doing great HIIT workouts on the bike for less than a year, I had to junk it and am now looking for a new one.

"I have an eight-month old toy poodle.She has a very calm, laid-back nature, until she has to ride in a car. Then she shakes, drools excessively, and sometimes vomits, even on very short rides. My vet prescribed an anti-nausea/anti-anxiety medication, and it did help with the vomiting. However, it had to be administered at least two hours before a car ride, and it was not inexpensive. I read a non-fiction book recently called Travels With Casey, about a man who takes a cross-country trip in an RV with his Lab. Casey freaked out during thunderstorms, which is really bad when on the road, so his owner bought him a &quot;Thunder-shirt&quot;. First night on the road:thunder and lightning. With his shirt on, Casey didn't even flinch. I was impressed, so I looked up &quot;Thunder-shirts&quot; on Amazon. Actual Thunder-shirt was a bit pricey at $50+ for a six pound puppy, and I'll admit, I was still a bit skeptical about the whole concept. I found the &quot;Mellow Shirt&quot;, and the very first reviewer said it calmed her dog to the point of no drooling, no shaking, and no vomiting! This item was also cheaper. After reading many reviews about the Mellow Shirt helping with anxiety about fireworks, separation, and car rides, I decided it was worth a try. When I received it, I let April wear it around the house for a while, because I did not want her to immediately associate it with the car. It fit her perfectly and she actually seemed to enjoy having it on. Ok, after a couple of hours, the test: a car ride of about four miles. My April was a different puppy; for the first time ever she sat up, looked around, even wagged her tail. No drooling, no vomiting, 0 anxiety!!! I have taken her on increasingly longer rides, all with the same result! This simple concept of a hug from a shirt is nothing short of a miracle in my opinion!",0.9696,406,20.3,0.3,2.38088

It makes it so easy to log your food intake and water intake.  I like how it tracks my steps and sleep patterns (I knew my sleep pattern was not always great and it is nice to see how I am sleeping).  I am definitely motivated to lose weight and even shared this with my doctor.  She was happy to have something to share with her other patients that ask her what else they can do to lose weight.

"I was debating between this and the Pescador 12. I'm glad I got the 10, as it is light enough for me to load onto a roof rack by myself. The only complaint I have with portability is that the side carry handles aren't in the right place. If you hold it by the handle, there's more weight on the back end than the front. Not a major problem, but it makes carrying it by yourself harder than it should be. My only other complaint is that the rod holders are really bad. They are too big, so I am afraid to use them for fear of my rods falling out. For a kayak called ""Pescador"", that is surprising.<br /><br />As far as tracking and speed go, this thing is great. It seems like a good balance between general purpose recreation and fishing. It is stable enough for me to turn around and access a milk crate in the back without risk of tipping. While there is no dry storage directly in front of the seat, I have been able to (carefully) access the dry storage in the bow when necessary.<br /><br />Lastly, I have found zero need for scupper plugs. Fully loaded my kayak carries about 200 lbs, and it is a very dry ride. This thing is great, and I would gladly buy it again.",0.9327,271,20.846153846153847,0.3,2.3698099999999998

"The hooks are sharp and strong, but there are definitely quality issues with these. The eye on one of the hooks was badly formed and had no hole, making it unusable.

"Price is right, but not as effective as other shad darts in my tackle box. I just used these, and I foul-hooked 5 shad. Not a one actually bit the hook. This makes me think there were tons of shad in the water, but none were interested in biting these. I should note that a different brand's shad dart was effective, so the fish were biting. I'll keep using these and update if performance improves. I also caught a 5-lb catfish on one of these, and it bent the hook.",0.3883,104,14.857142857142858,0.0,1.3164900000000002
"I bought this kayak a year ago, and have used it close to 30 times. I have used it as a tandem kayak and as a fishing kayak (not simultaneously - that would be a tight squeeze). It has survived rocky rivers with low water, dozens of fishing trips, and being dragged up boat ramps. I am really impressed with the durability. Also, it fits in the trunk of my Toyota Corolla. Awesome! My only complaint is that the inflatable seats aren't very comfortable for long outings. Also, Amazon is WAY overpriced for this product. When I bought mine, I found it elsewhere for 30% less (still new!). I definitely recommend looking around online before buying here. A good price is closer to $200.<br /><br />Year 2 update:<br /><br />The inflatable seats were the first thing to go. Both seats only hold air for a few hours now. They are made out of a much cheaper material than the rest of the kayak, so I guess that was to be expected. I also got my first puncture on one of the pontoons. I used the patching kit and recommended adhesive, but the patch keeps coming off. I think it is because it falls along a natural crease when the kayak is deflated. That constant bending puts a lot of stress on the patch. It's annoying to keep re-patching it, but it does at least hold air while the patch is on.",0.5531,292,16.22222222222222,0.2,2.22593

"I like to give reviews early to give my first impressions of a product.  First of all, this is packed very well, so chances of damage in shipping seem minimal. (Mine had no damage.)  I had a little trouble getting it out of the box, as everything is hooked together with plastic zip ties.  The black color that I got is gorgeous and very classy looking.  I haven't gotten it assembled yet, as there are a number of things to attach (front fender, front wheel, pedals, seat and front tire).  Assembly is a little challenging and I had problems even though I am usually good at assembling things.  One thing that stopped me from putting it together is that the manual recommends you use a lithium based grease on moving parts when you assemble.  I had no grease at all, so picked up some from a bike shop.  I learned something important from the bike shop.  DO NOT use lithium based grease recommended in the manual if you live in a very hot dry climate.  It will dry too much and lock up the wheels of the bike.  Other places where it is colder or with more humidity, it works fine.  The grease that I got is called Polylube 1000 Polyurea Grease.  The manual also confused me about the brakes as it describes brake cables, but I discovered that this model uses coaster brakes, so there are no cables.  (Apparently they wrote one manual for several different models of bikes.)  I am glad for the coaster brakes, as I learned to ride a bike with coaster brakes.  I never liked hand cable brakes, as it always seemed at some point the cable would break or brakes always needing adjustment.  Note that I got the single speed model and it should be perfect for me. Seems ideal for casual flatland riding, which is what I plan to use it for.  Now I just need to get a helmet and bicycle pump.  The tires do come inflated, but not sufficiently.  Update:  I got the bike together, sort of, but the front fender was not positioned correctly.  Also had a big problem with the seat post.  Be very careful to make sure the seat post is attached to the seat before you insert the post into the frame.  I dropped the post into the frame and it dropped in so far that the seat would not attach to it and I couldn't get it out again.  BE VERY CAREFUL about this.<br />I ended up taking this to a bike shop and they got it out and attached and adjusted the seat; adjusted the handlebars and inflated the tires to the correct pressure.  I also had trouble mounting the front fender, which I had mounted wrong; they fixed that too.  They also adjusted the chain, which was a little too tight out of the box.  They tried to adjust the back fender, but the screws holding it were cranked in so tight that they would not move.  A word about the grease.  Grease is only inside sealed bearings and you can't get to them without special tools.  The bike has proper lubrication out of the box, so only after some use and some time would you need to lubricate it.  The one place I did use grease is on the threads on the pedals when attaching them and the bike shop confirmed that was the right thing to do.  Unless you are really familiar with bike mechanics, best to get some professional help on this to make sure everything is good.  I should knock off a star or two from my rating for the problems I had and the confusing manual, but it is such a nice bike that I am staying with the 5-star rating.",0.9644,707,19.63888888888889,0.6,2.46932
"Have never owned a set of dumbbells before, so can't compare these to any previous ones.  They do appear to be well made and they went together quite easily.  I am a senior citizen and my first work out with these was just getting them in from the doorstep where UPS dropped them and then getting them unpacked.  The entire set is pretty heavy for someone lacking a lot of arm strength.  As I get older, I am losing strength, so these look like they are excellent for increasing strength.  I liked the fact that they have a nice storage case too.  Of course I can't move it very easily once everything is in it, so if you get this, put the case right where you want it before putting the pieces back in it, unless you are young and strong.  There are 2 sizes of weights, so you have several possibilities of combinations.  The bars that hold the weights are pretty heavy by themselves, so if you are very much out of shape, you can start with the bars alone at first; then add the lighter weights; then switch to the heavier ones and then finally both light and heavy.  There are eight weights, up to 2 for each end of each dumbbell.  The only thing I could find wrong was that the printed instructions in one place showed 3 different sizes of weights and 2 in another.  There are just 2 sizes.  These are simple enough to assemble that you don't need printed instructions anyway.  I really think you will like this set as much as I did.",0.9848,299,21.357142857142858,0.2,2.35544
"Don't mistake my headline - it is a great ottoman, but don't like that it is also referenced as a camping chair as it only supports up to 80 pounds.  That's not my issue, however.

"Totally my fault for not reading the ingredient label. I truly didn’t think this would have anything other than potatoes and salt. Which is the beauty of freeze drying foods.

Gotta love the so called FDA, that is not always looking out for our best interest.<br />I truly do blame our FDA more than the company. Who’s watching the watchers?<br />Many added chemicals to the American food supply are not only banned, but illegal in many other countries for known harms to humans, as well as the environment our government tells us their care so much about.<br />Illegal - Let that sink in for a moment.<br />Illegal for known harms such as, but not limited to: infertility, cancer, ADHD, learning disabilities, ADD, neurological disorders and neurotoxic, diabetes, endocrine disrupters, inflammation to name a few.<br />One should ask themselves, and perhaps their government, politicians and health agencies this. If other countries can create the same or similar products without using these chemicals, then why do we Americans not get the same?<br />Celery seed & rosemary can be used as a food preservative. Natural coloring can come from carrots, turmeric, beets etc. Do why use artificial chemical coloring dyes?<br />Until we shut off Netflix for a bit, learn, share, and get completely frustrated and angry, then demand change by not buying these products as a first step, why would they ever stop.<br />Oh and BTW, these chemicals substitutes aren’t always even cheaper.

"As a person who purchases fleece to make blankets, I know my material well. This fleece material is one of the cheapest that can be purchased. If you look closely at it when it arrives (I bought it online) it looks as though its slightly clumpy or matted from the start. This means that after 4-6 washes this fleece material will definitely have a matted appearance and appear much more worn than it is. The fleece fabric used is also very thin. If you turn the jacket inside out and push your finger  firmly into the fabric, it appears that it wouldn't take much pressure to tear. I'm not suggesting gauging it with a blunt object, but it should withstand normal pushing as a clothing item will get when be put on and taken off etc. Again., thats a test us fleece blanket makers check for when purchasing fabric for a blanket that we desire to last through years of &#34;normal&#34; wear and washing. I honestly do not feel this jacket would hod up well beyond maybe 6 months.<br />Columbia is known for having quality merchandise so that is why I chose this maker. I am very disappointed in the quality of the material. I am certain the reviews on here are from buyers who received their jacket, see how soft it is, tried it on and thought it was well made and left a glowing review. I am curious to hear an update from a buyer after they have worn and washed this jacket a few times. I bought this jacket on sale for $36.00 (original price tag of $60.00) Unfortunately I  am returning it today.<br /> Old Navy is known for using VERY cheap material for a majority of their clothing, however they use much better quality fleece for their jackets. I know because I own a couple Old Navy fleece jackets. they're not as stylish as Columbia. Quite plain actually, but mine have held up for several years and still look nice.  Old Navy fleece jackets go on sale for $9.99 - $14.99 often, especially around Christmas. Looks like I'll be heading back there to pick a few more up.",0.9713,417,23.166666666666668,4.9,2.16139

Very easy to fill. Everyone that tried them said they are so comfy and 1 said it was better than his bed pillow. You get 2 in the set and each one has its own storage case. They also come with a velour cover for the top. The plastic is good because its not a slippery type so the cover stays on in place. Easy to deflate when done. Just a bit harder to get back in the storage bag sometimes if you dont get all tge air out lol.,0.9381,97,13.857142857142858,0.1,2.3114299999999997

The description does say that it's good for kayaking, paddle boating and similar activities which are usually in shallower areas  which makes sense for a 50. Just be sure to do your research!

I started looking up the requirements for PFD's in my state and for kayaking and canoeing, you need Coast Guard Approved ones. So I'm not really sure if I can even use this one. So keep that in mind. It's possible that these are similar to the ones that are CG approved, but they just didn't submit to the testing or fill out the paperwork. I do not know the answer.

My husband is impressed with this Bushnell night vision monocular. His primary reason is because it works much better than another brand night vision one he has. We have a huge backyard. The infra red light goes really far and he was able to see all the way to the fence at the end of the yard from the deck. He's estimating that the distance is at least 60 feet. Batteries are required (not included). It was easy to figure out how to use. It comes with everything you need (except the batteries).

There are 6 slip pockets around the inside of the bag. There's a zipper closure on the main compartment so your stuff won't spill out if it tips over. And at the top center of the bag, on the outside, is a small hidden slip pocket. You could get keep your keys or phone in it.

My daughter was asking me for one of these hoola hoops recently. She said they're very popular on TikTok. This item comes with a thin waist trimmer/wrap. The hoola hoop comes in pieces and requires some simple assembly. She had to take out 3 or 4 of the pieces to fit her waist. I am a plus size 16/18 and it fit me snuggly with just one piece removed. It works well. My daughter really got into it. I couldn't wait to take it off - it wasn't my thing! I think I felt a little claustrophobic in it. My daughter currently has really long acrylic nails and found that she needed help to take it off.

I didn't have an air compressor with me, or an electric pump, so I had to inflate this on my own. My husband took over blowing air into it  because I wasn't making a lot of progress.

"My 20 year old has been wanting one of these for a while. There's a lake near her campus and there is always a lot of people paddle boarding. This was easy to set up, though it did take a little while to get it fully inflated.  This comes with a pump, paddle (single bladed), ankle strap, and a repair kit. Everything fits nicely into a backpack which makes it easy for transporting. Once it's inflated, it is extremely rigid and it's hard to tell the difference between this and a non-inflatable one.

He heats them up and while they're warm and pliable, he puts them up against curved surfaces such as large buckets and as they cool down, they retain the shape. These are smaller than the last ones he got from the store, but they are a good size for creating shoulder pads or smaller needed costume parts. These have been working well for his latest creation.",0.964,126,15.75,0.1,2.3192

"This inflatable paddleboard has exceeded my expectations. I love that it's versatile and can easily convert to a kayak. It's much sturdier than I would anticipated. This is not your swimming pool float quality. Once it is inflated, you can see how sturdy and firm it is. I was able to set this up on my own for the most part. It does take a little bit of time to inflate. It took about 5 minutes to get it looking like a paddleboard, but it took at least another 5 minutes to get it to a PSI of 12. It took a little longer to get it up to 15 PSI which is the recommended minimum. My husband took over after my 5 minutes because I was getting tired! We will definitely want to invest in an electric pump. A manual pump is included and it's also recommended for deflating it as well. I tried to deflate it without the pump and it did release a lot of the air by just sitting there. But it wasn't enough to pack it back up so we used the pump again. It comes with a paddle that can be converted to the 2 types of paddles - kayak & paddleboard. The seat is easy to install with clips/D-Rings. There's a repair kit.

Now with the addition of this Segway Ninebot Kick scooter, they can ride around together. This scooter is sturdy and heavy duty. It goes pretty fast. In fact, it surprised my daughter with how fast it goes. It took her a little longer to get accustomed to it because it it's a different balancing situation than the other one we have, but once she got used to it, it was easy. It does use an app, but it's the same one that the balancing scooter uses, so that was easy. My daughter is a college student and she says she wouldn't consider taking it on campus. I think it's more of the fact that no one else is riding electric scooters than it being something she wouldn't feel comfortable doing.

My husband attached these kayak racks to some wood pieces that he had already installed onto the trailer. It holds the 2 kayaks on their sides which leaves about half of the utility trailer available for bikes and other gear.

She was able to mimic the movements she would use paddling and it was okay. She really did like how she looked in it and found it to be very flattering.

"My husband and I have beach cruiser style bikes. We often take them to the nearby bike trails (former train track) for riding. The trail is pretty busy and we are often passed by more serious bike riders. Recently my husband made a comment that we needed mirrors for our bikes. So when I saw these, I decided to check them out. This comes with 2 mirrors, so we installed one on each of our bikes.  It also comes with one hex wrench. The wrench was not in the first book we opened, so my husband got out his own hex wrenches. After we installed the first one, we opened the second box and found the hex wrench. My bike is a Huffy one. We had to cut off the end of the rubber handlebar grip for the mirror base to go into. My husband's bike is a Schwinn and his handle bars had a plastic plug in the end and so he had to use his drill to allow room for the base of the mirror to go into. We did try to remove the handle grips first to no avail. It's possible that mountain bikes are different, but that's what we had to do. Once the mirrors were in place, we rode around the neighborhood to test them out. It took some trial and error to get them positioned the way we wanted them to be. We haven't had to put our bikes on the bike rack yet. We are going to have to be careful how we position the bikes so the mirrors don't get bumped or broken.

I wasn't really expecting to have any problems, but thinking possibly that a little water might get splashed into our kayaks. As it turned out, I tipped over in my kayak. The current was just fast enough that I wasn't able to get back in it. My husband ended up tipping over trying to help me. We ended up floating down the river for a while until we could make it to the river bank. End of a long story, the bags kept everything dry! Not a drop of water got in. I wore mine around my waist while my husband put his in a covered compartment on his kayak. I was walking/floating in the water for at least 20 minutes in water that was up to my chest.

"My daughter will tell you that she didn't need another Georgia t-shirt! But it's very cute! She finally came around and decided she liked it. It's a soft, light weight t-shirt. It has a cute distressed design. It's true to size and fit as expected.",0.9515,56,9.333333333333334,0.0,1.88545
"I am a plus size mom. I usually wear a women's size 16-18. For items like this, I prefer to wear men's shirts because they are often longer and roomier. I often wear layers under pullovers and women's sizing is usually a little snugger. This XL size fits nicely on me. The longer length covers my backside well. The garment is constructed well. The zipper glides easily. And there are pockets! It is very warm and comfy. It will be perfect for showing support to my alma mater during the winter months.",0.9577,107,9.727272727272728,0.0,2.28731
"I have tried a few inverted umbrellas. They do offer some features that traditional umbrellas don't have. They're are definitely some trade offs! I love being able to see the cute leopard print. That has nothing to do with functionality, but it's visually appealing. The umbrella opens fairly easy. I took this out on the deck and opened/closed it at least a dozen times. In at least half of the attempts, the umbrella didn't click into place when fully extended. I had to retry it again and sometimes again. The handle is easy to hold and grip. It's also comfortable when holding it for longer periods of time. I haven't had to go out in the rain since this arrived, but with the other inverted umbrellas, I do like how it's easy to use when getting in or out of the car. And of course I really like how when you have a wet umbrella, the moisture closes inside keeping you from getting hit with more water. Overall, I do like it, but it was a little frustrating that it didn't always click into place.",0.9827,214,15.285714285714286,0.0,1.89481
"This is a sturdy water bottle. I like that it's partially made with plant material! The bottle is pretty basic. You have to fully remove the lid to drink from it. There is no straw or spout. It's see through so you can see how much liquid is remaining. The lid actually serves as a handle, too. My daughter uses a caribiner clip to attach it to her belongings. Overall, it's a nice, simple water bottle.",0.7644,91,10.11111111111111,0.0,1.82932
I've stopped buying bottle water unless absolutely necessary. This reusable water bottle is nice. It is a rigid plastic material that feels pretty sturdy. The lid has a handle that can be moved up or down. There's a button to release the straw which works very well. I found that I had to push the straw in a little tighter for it to access the water easier. Otherwise it met the bottom surface and kept water from getting through. I like that the parts are dishwasher safe.,0.9216,97,12.125,0.0,1.8764800000000001
"My son is a big guy and I'm always keeping him in mind when it comes to camping style chairs. I used to go for whatever was cheapest, but those often have really low weight maximums. This is a solid folding camping style chair that can accommodate 300 pounds. It feels sturdy when sitting in it. I'm a plus size mom myself and it's nerve wracking when you sit in a chair and it makes a noise or gives too much. This chair is pretty comfortable. It's a good, mid-firmness level. It's not super firm that reminds you of sitting in a wooden desk chair, but it's not one that you sink way down into and have troubles getting back up. It's really a good in between feel to it. The cup holder is not too small. There's a pocket/cooler on one arm which is nice. I really like this chair!",0.9445,174,14.5,0.4,2.40335

She really likes the motivational markings on the side.  There's also a strainer so you can infuse fresh fruit into it as well. She likes the wrist strap, but I found that it gets wet easily when filling it. I supposed I could remove it before filling it, but that's an extra step.

The back of the chair is a little higher than a lot of similar type chairs. The cup holder is a decent size - a little larger than some chairs, but I'm not sure it would accommodate the big gulp size cups, but it might. I really like the storage compartment on the other arm. This should be something that all camping chairs have! The chair is not one that you can just sink into. It's a firmer chair and I personally don't think I would enjoy sitting in it for an extended period of time. However, I realize that's a personal issue. The chair is a good quality.",0.9415,160,16.0,0.1,1.91245

The instructions were really hard to read and follow due to the small size. I would love to have a larger one that I could hang up on the wall of my home gym.

They don't interfere with my steps, but make each step a little heavier. When the weather is warmer, I will wear these on my walks outside.",0.8151,101,12.625,0.0,1.84453

It's not so much a cooler as an insulated bag, but with some ice, it will keep drinks chilled a little longer than without. The table is easy to set up. It's got four cup holders and a spot in the center that can hold a bowl of chips or other snacks. The table is surprisingly sturdy.",0.8316,123,17.571428571428573,0.0,2.24948

They have a lot of weight to them and it will be much harder for them to come up unexpectedly. They don't bend easily either.

"Finally, a comfortable camping chair with a high weight capacity!! I'm a plus size fifty something woman. The weight limit on this chair is almost half as much as I weigh, so I feel confident sitting it in. I've been in chairs that had a maximum weight of 150 pounds and it's a bit scary! No one ones to be the one who sits in a chair and causes it to break! My adult son is a big guy at about 300 pounds. He can easily sit in this chair, without worrying about it. We also have a few big guys in our friend group. I'm pleased that we have a chair that will accommodate them. It feels sturdy and well made. It only has one cup holder, and it's the size of a regular can of soda. I was a little disappointed with that. Today, so many chairs have two cup holders and even side pouches. This cup holder won't even hold my mobile phone. Also, the carrying bag that comes with this chair is very thin and I have questions as to how long it will hold up. So while it's a very good chair, there are some areas for improvement.",0.9556,234,14.625,0.0,1.8866800000000001
"I used to be intimidated by pepper sprays and would never get one. I wish I had tried them out much sooner, because they do give me peace of mind. These canisters have about 25 uses per one, so you can actually try them out without worrying about using them up before you need them. The sprayer is secure until you unlock it so it doesn't accidently go off at the wrong time. It is very easy to use. It's very obvious as to what direction to point it at so you don't have to worry about pointing it in the wrong direction. They come with keyrings with a quick release feature.

However, it's too large for that. It would fit in the backpack if I didn't have anything else it it, but I have a lot of other things that I need to transport with us, so it didn't work for that.

When I am wearing a coat, I want it to fit without being tight in the arms, especially if I am wearing long sleeves or layers. This has plenty of arm space in the sleeves. I can zip the coat up without being constrictive. And on the other side, it's not baggy either. It's really a great fit! We've had some early cold temperatures and I've gotten to wear it already. It kept me toasty warm! It doesn't compress as much as some puffer jackets. It's made well. The zipper is heavy and sturdy. I am very pleased with it.",0.9723,144,11.076923076923077,5.5,3.94169

"I immediately noticed a difference in this umbrella when I opened it. It has a solid feel and is very sturdy. The ribs are noticeably heavy compared to most umbrellas that I have tried. The one touch open/close button works as it should. I have become accustomed to that feature on umbrellas these days, so I'm glad it works well. It's average in size. You could squeeze two people under it in a pinch, but one person is probably better. The material seems to repel water well. It came with a case, but to be honest, I probably won't use it. I usually keep my umbrellas in the car door pocket or in the side pocket of my backpack. The price is actually comparable to what I've seen at the stores for higher quality umbrellas. The cheaper brand name umbrellas are usually 2/3rds this one's price and it's significantly sturdier than them.",0.9318,174,14.5,0.1,2.3095399999999997

I volunteer a lot with my daughter's marching band and during the band season, I will be on my feet for hours. My lower have of my body will be overly tired and sore.

"We like to entertain in our large backyard, so I am always looking for outdoor games and activities. I prefer that they don't take up a lot of storage space and that they are easy to set up. With the exception of the soccer ball, everything can fit easily into the box. The flag poles are collapsible, similar to the tent stakes that we have with our quick set up tent. The ""holes"" are thin plastic and I wonder about long term durability there. I was hoping that I could take this to school and use it with the kids in PE class, but alas, the flags have spikes at the ends to go into the ground so it can rest on flat, smooth surfaces. We didn't have any issues with the length of the grass interfering with the pieces, but our lawn was freshly mowed when we played it. I could see it being an issue though. The set comes with a small air pump which is a nice if you didn't already own one. The game is fun and was enjoyed by everyone playing.

The sizing is a little small in my opinion. They are labeled L/XL. I have medium to large hands. My husband has large hands. Our son has XL hands.

"I have a 17 year old daughter and was thinking of her when I ordered these. First of all, it says there are 5 tests in the package, but there are actually 10. There are two tests per sheet and 5 sheets included. The paper tests are in a matchbook style folder. I think it would be great if that was then inside a vinyl holder or something to keep it from getting torn or dirty while being stored inside your purse. It says to make sure you read all the directions before administering a test. I found the directions to be extremely difficult to read because they are so tiny! I am not the target audience, so I guess that's okay. It's pretty easy to use. You put a drop of water on each of the test spots and then wait for it to dry which takes a few minutes. It's not a particularly discreet procedure. If you were on a blind date and took this out to test your drink, you can't easily hide your actions. I tested this using plain tap water. The directions say that the water will cause a light blue mark, which is normal.  Mine did just that. You're suppose to tear out the test sheet before testing the drink. But if you only use one test, you still have an unused test on the other half of the sheet, but there's really no place to put it securely.  I was not able to test it with anything that would cause it to have a positive reading, so I can only assume that it will work as indicated. I definitely think it's a good thing to have on hand when you have doubts.",0.9586,323,17.0,0.4,1.60758
"First of all, I wouldn't call this a jacket. In my opinion, it's a pullover. I think of jackets as being something that's full zip, not quarter zip. As far as athletic pullovers go, this is pretty good. It's mid-weight and will provide adequate warmth in the fall/spring, possibly even enough for mild winters in the south. The outer material is a polyester waffle weave type fabric. The inside is a soft fleece material. The zippers are heavy grade and zip well. The chest pocket is the only pocket on the garment. It is not large enough to accommodate most cellphones. The Tennessee logo is made of cloth and is embroidered onto the pullover. My husband is 6'2&#34; and weighs about 195 pounds. He wears mediums and larges in shirts. This fits him fine with a little bit of room so he could wear a layer underneath. The sleeve length is fine, too.

The fins are a little large on her, but since they are open back, she is able to adjust them so they mostly fit. She probably could have gotten by with a smaller size, but these work fine. The mask is clear with good peripheral viewing. It provides a nice seal and keeps the water out. My husband was impressed with the snorkel. The purge valve is much easier to use than his.

Some equipment is fine to rent, but my husband thought she should own her own mask at the least. This diving mask easily fits both my daughter and my husband with a little adjustment. It creates a good seal around the face and does a good job of keeping the water out. And when water did get inside, it was easy to clear the mask by pressing at the top ridge of the mask at the forehead as it should. The sides of the mask are black, so you don't have peripheral vision when wearing these like you would with clear sides.

The rusting was minimal, but apparent in more than one piece. I expected something meant for outdoor play would be resistant to rusting so quickly. Assembly was more difficult than we expected. My husband is usually really good at putting things together. The instructions were not the easiest to follow. We had to get the picture of the product from the website to see how it was supposed to look in order to finish it. It's a nice, large size.

My teenage daughter would use it while sitting on the sofa and watching TV. We moved it downstairs to the basement and it rotates between my husband's desk and our college aged son's desk. In comparison to exercise bikes, it's a lot quieter than full on bikes. It's not silent. I would compare the noise level to what you would hear from a desk fan. It doesn't have a very high resistance, but it's adequate. My daughter was surprised at how sore her legs were after using it because it was comfortable to use it and she didn't seem to be working that hard.

The colors are vibrant. The tag identifies it as an officially licensed product. There are at least 4 small snags/holes on the front of it. It looks like it may have been folded and attached together with plastic tag or something because the holes are evenly spaced and if you connected them it would make a square. There was no plastic tag on it when I got it. The helmet is made of plastic. The images are clear. This is definitely for decoration only and not meant to offer any protection.

"I have never used any type of pepper spray or personal safety items. I thought it might give some peace of mind during some situations. The items are two separate devices, so there are two things to keep track of. Ideally, it would be great if they were combined somehow into one device. Both items have a key chain attachment so you can keep it with your keys. I have put them on a lanyard instead though, for fear of accidently setting them off. I keep the lanyard inside the outer pocket of my purse. I can also wear the lanyard around my neck if desired. I was afraid to test these items, but I did. To activate the alarm, you pull the pin with the key chain. Once it's removed, a loud, piercing sound is made. It frightened the cats immediately! It wasn't too loud that it hurts your ears. It kind of reminded me of a car alarm sound. The alarm stops when you reinsert the pin and click it in place.  My husband and I tested the pepper spray outside. It was a windy day, so we made sure that we didn't spray it against the wind. A reddish orange stream of pepper spray was dispensed. The description of the product says it goes about 10 feet. We didn't measure it, but that seems pretty close to what we got. I like that you get about 25 sprays from it. I did get some on my finger. It dripped down from the dispenser. I immediately wiped my hand on the grass, then went inside and washed it thoroughly.  I was able to get it off because it didn't burn or sting. It doesn't have much of a smell.

"This first aid kit has just about everything you might need for an emergency. It contains an assortment of basic first aid items, such as band-aids, wipes, and gauze pads. It also has an instant cold pack, tweezers, triangle bandage, disposable gloves, safety pins, scissors,  tape, and a CPR mask. In addition to the first aid supplies, there are also some survival items too. It includes a compass, whistle, rain poncho, and emergency blanket. The scissors are pretty weak as far as scissors go, but I did test them out and they did cut. The tweezers are solid and a nice quality. Everything fits inside the zipper case, but there's not room for much more inside it. I will probably try to add a small tube of ibuprofen and some ointment for scrapes to make my kit complete. The size of this is good to fit inside a backpack or in the car without taking up too much room.",0.8591,186,18.6,0.2,2.31773
"My husband and I have been doing Weight Watchers this year and were very excited to get this for indoor exercise. As far as putting it together, it wasn't too difficult for my husband. If you have never assembled things like this, it may be more challenging.  It does come with a little &#34;L&#34; wrench, but fortunately my husband has a couple of hex wrench sets that he was able to use which sped up the assembly. He put most of it together in the living room and then when he had the two halves of it (front and back), he carried them down to the basement where we are going to keep it to finish. Our bike did come with two left handles. There was a sheet inside the box that said if you are missing any pieces, contact them instead of the store where you purchased it. In our experience, it's not that uncommon to have an incorrect or missing piece. I immediately e-mailed the company and they shipped out the new handle. This was actually a lot easier to get the missing piece than it is with some of furniture that we have had to put together in the past! The bike works quite well. My husband has been using it almost every morning. The seat is not very comfortable, but we have found that to be the case with other exercise equipment. I put a small pillow behind my back when I'm riding it and that improves that a lot. After reading some of the other reviews, I expected it to be really noisy and loud, but it's not at all. My husband was using his own bike on a stand to keep it in place and this is not much louder or noisier than that. It's also a little quieter than our treadmill. We don't have to turn the TV up too loud for it to be heard while using it.  There are a few different levels of resistance and it is pretty easy to change those for your workout. Overall, we are pleased with this recumbent bike and the customer service that the company provides.",0.9063,407,20.35,1.5,2.32189
"I recently joined Weight Watchers and was looking for an easy, low impact exercise/activity to do. The Simply Fit board has been a lot of fun so far. For my first few uses, I followed the Low Impact Workout DVD. It was super helpful at getting me started with the Fit board. The instructor has a nice, calming voice and has a positive &amp; encouraging vibe. As someone who is not a fan of exercise, I felt this this DVD was an appropriate level for me. It's broken into short chapters/workouts. I felt that I didn't have to do all of them at one sitting. I would do one or two during a time frame. The DVD instructed me on how to stand &amp; use the Simply Fit Board which was very helpful in the beginning. Production on the DVD is professional. Overall, I found the DVD to be a great tool for the Simply Fit Board.",0.9865,180,15.0,6.1,4.12595
"The mat is a nice addition to the Simply Fit Board, though I found it not necessary to use. I have been using my board on my carpeted living room floor. I've tried it with the mat, but I personally think it's easier to control the board without it. It is helpful when using the board on the tile flooring though. The mat is a little larger than the board itself. It's not very thick, but it does have a grippy type surface on the back so it will help you stay in place better as opposed to sliding around. It rolls up easily for storage. I didn't notice any strong smells or odors from it.",0.9545,131,16.375,0.2,1.9463500000000002
"I joined Weight Watchers about 6 weeks ago. I have never been a fan of exercise, but this looked different. I have been using this regularly for at least the last month and I absolutely love it!!! This is a game changer! I have a Fitbit Alta that I got for Christmas. If I don't get a minimum of 250 steps in per hour, it buzzes a reminder for me to get up and move. I can twist on this for a few minutes and reach my hourly Fitbit goal. I also get on this first thing in the morning to give my steps a boost. I can earn about 1000 steps in about ten minutes or so. I rotate between twists and rocking back and forth. I weigh over 200 pounds and have not had any issues with cracking or breaking. I also have not had any problems with me knees when using it. The first few times I used it, I ended up turning in circles. It took me a while to get that under control and now I tend to stay in the same spot for most of my use. My husband made fun of me when I first started using it, but now he gets on it while playing games on the x-box. I have learned that I need to wear shoes or go barefoot when using it. It's too slippery when wearing just socks. Since I have joined Weight Watchers, I have lost 19 pounds. I believe that the Simply Fit Board has definitely helped me regarding my activity level.",0.9777,293,15.421052631578949,0.5,2.44331
"This stainless steel water bottle works pretty well for my high school daughter. First of all, it's not too wide or large so it fits in the side pouch of her backpack. A lot of water bottles these days don't fit. The lid screws securely and doesn't leak. It is a little hard to get the ice cubes into mouth of the bottle. I find that it works best if I put in the cubes one at a time which can be a little time consuming. It does an excellent job of keeping the water chilled. There's always plenty of ice left at the end of the day. It fits pretty well into your hand. It would be nice if there was some way to keep the lid attached to the actual bottle so it doesn't get lost. It's a very nice looking bottle. The logo is pretty small and discreet.

"I love it when the weather cooperates with any free time I may have. One of my favorite things to do is read in the hammock. But the weather can't be too hot or too cool. Now that the heat of summer is fading, I am hoping to have some outdoor reading time soon. This hammock will be perfect for that! It's very sturdy and well made. The triple stitching is really solid and can supposedly accommodate over 600 pounds! The carabiner are ropes are strong, too. I love that this comes with hammock straps! Those really do make a difference when setting up your hammock. It gives you more flexibility as to where you hang it from. The trees we use for our hammocks have thicker trunks than what the ropes can go around. But with hammock straps, we can use a tree with a larger trunk.

This bag is pretty basic. I wish there was an outer pocket or an interior divided section. The straps are securely attached, but not adjustable.

"My husband just used this on a trip to Las Vegas as his personal item. He flew on Spirit airlines and they charge for carry-on items. Passengers can take one personal item as long as it fits under the seat in front of you.  He was looking through the house for a small backpack to use, but most of them were too big. He's 6'2 and he wanted a little room under the seat for his feet. This pack had just arrived at our house, so I offered it to him. It was perfect. Since it's made of a thinner material than typical backpacks, he was able to squish it easily to fit under the seat and allow himself some foot room.

I immediately stood a little taller and straighter. I have tried another waist trainer before and this one is much smoother looking under clothing. When I was wearing my other one, there was extra fabric behind the velcro which caused the velcro fastener to stick out a little more than the rest of the belt. This one gives a smooth line so you can't tell that the fastener is there under your clothing.

But when this became available during a recent promotion, I was curious about it, so I happily ordered it at a reduced cost. I've been using it on and off for the last two weeks. It is surprisingly comfortable. Once it's on, it's barely noticeable. I thought I might get overheated while wearing it, but so far, that hasn't been an issue. It does give immediate slimming results. And it's a lot more comfortable than other products I've used for that purpose. There is some bulk, so I've decided not to wear it under certain clothing items where it is visible because of its thickness. One day, my lower back was hurting a lot. I put the waist trimmer on and it offered immediate relief. I haven't noticed any permanent loss of inches, but I have not been wearing it every day. But just for the lower back relief and the immediate slimming look under clothes, I am very happy.",0.9813,212,15.142857142857142,0.0,1.89439
"My daughter & husband like to go on evening bike rides. Although the days are longer now, they still often come back after dark. When I was given the chance to purchase this bike light at a reduced price in exchange for my opinions, I was excited to do so. First of all, I really like that the bike light is actually a removable flash light, which can come in handy. The flashlight is a pretty nice one. It's made out of aluminum and has a good, sturdy feel to it. The beam it produces is bright and there are a few different modes to use. It fits into the holder easily. It also comes out very easily which makes me wonder how well it stays in place. So far, there haven't been any troubles. The holder does need to be tightened every so often - after every few rides. Batteries are not included, which would have been nice. I do like that it comes with a lifetime warranty. My daughter really likes the glowing purple ring when the light is in use!",0.9881,206,14.714285714285714,0.0,1.89643
Beautiful Tervis Tumbler!! We purchased this for my daughter's middle school orchestra teacher as an end of the year gift. Her teacher LOVED it!!! I am a huge fan of Tervis products.

"What a great set of resistance bands!!!There is a nice variety of thicknesses, offering a wide range of resistance. They appear to be strong & heavy duty, so I don't worry about them breaking. They are easy to attach to the foam handles with carabiner type clips. I am very pleased that they come with an illustrated, color guide that shows different types of exercises to do with the bands. I've ordered other resistance bands in the past that have not come with any instructions at all! It's impressive that you can actually get a full work out with the contents of this fairly small bag!

"My husband is a very active &#34;Band Dad&#34;. Many of the jobs he helps the marching band with take place at night & in the dark parking lots. He's used a reflective vest in the past, but when I was saw the opportunity to purchase this during a promotional period, I thought this would make a good alternative. The straps are stretchy and adjustable, so it easily accommodates adults of all sizes. It's surprisingly comfortable. I tried it on and wore it around the house for over an hour and barely noticed it was even on. My favorite thing about this is that my husband can still wear his official band shirt & look like part of the crew because it doesn't block out the majority of the shirt as a solid piece of fabric does. Another nice benefit, is that when it's hot outside, you're not wearing an extra layer. The reflective bands are a nice bonus!",0.9942,185,20.55555555555556,0.0,2.29826
"This is a very nice set of resistance exercise bands. They feel very strong & sturdy. It's easy to tell the difference in the resistances because of the varied thicknesses. The thicker the band, the heavier the resistance. They come with a storage bag which is nice. It hardly takes up any room, so it's great for travel or small spaces. I am fairly new to using bands, so I went to their website hoping to find some instructions and tips, but there weren't any. I was able to find information on my own, but it would have been nice if they had included something with the bands.",0.9258,124,15.5,0.0,1.8777400000000002

"The dry bag is made out of a strong, waterproof material. This will be great for all kinds of outdoor activities! I got the larger of the 2 sizes. It holds a lot of stuff, but when you fold the top over once, then 3 more times as directed, that decreases the amount of storage by almost half. It still holds a lot, just keep that in mind. Of course, you could fold it fewer times, but that could affect the bag's ability to keep your belongings dry! I like the removable/adjustable shoulder straps. It was a little difficult for me to clip the strap onto the bag, but my husband didn't have any difficulties. Love the bonus phone case!",0.9752,139,15.444444444444445,0.0,1.89256
"I have looked at several different paddle leashes & none have been as good as this one. First of all, the brass clip is a huge plus. Most of the others that I looked at had plastic clips which are easily broken.  The coil design allows for ultimate flex. The leash unbuckles for a quick release if needed. All of the stitching appears to be strong. I tugged quite hard at all of the connecting &#34;joints&#34; and there were no rips, tears, or any reason at all to believe that it would not hold up to regular use. I'm not sure when I'll be able to test it out, but I will update my review if it does not perform as well as I expect.",0.0218,147,18.375,0.1,2.03654

You can easily clip on the handles using a carabiner type clip. They all store neatly inside the bag.

When it arrived, I showed my husband our bundle and he was very impressed. He's a Boy Scout leader & thought it was a very practical purchase. With 100 feet, we can give our daughter some to make camping bracelets for our family & still have over 50 feet for other uses.

Just what I needed for my home gym. I am a beginner at home workouts as gym membership was getting too expensive and so being on a budget I wanted a good sturdy bench that wasn't going to break the bank.

"This is a well packaged set of items with a bag to hold everything, even with ball inflated.  I'm older and was glad it was so easy to inflate the ball.  I wanted a new Pilates ring as a very old one is no longer flexible enough.  This one is smaller than my original one, but very nice.  I also happened to need the elastic circular bands for a particular physical therapy exercise I do so this was a win win win set of things.  There is a great poster with well-illustrated exercises for various pieces of equipment.  Again, at my age, some won't be appropriate, but the ones I care about are very useful and easy to figure out.  Did a small workout already and was pleased.

"To be honest, I am conflicted about this water bottle.  Maybe I expected it to be something it is not, as I see that many reviewers are very happy with the bottle.  It is true that the bottle does keep water cold for several hours, but I found the bottle very hard to squeeze, and each squeeze did not release much water.  In short, I had to really work to take a drink from this bottle.  Maybe it is because I am over 65 and not as strong as I used to be, but I did not like this bottle all that much.  I cannot in good conscience recommend it, unless you are familiar with this type of bottle and like the way it operates.",0.1729,139,23.166666666666668,0.0,1.2518700000000003
"I love my new walking sticks!  I had been experiencing a problem at times with balance, particularly on uneven surfaces, and a friend recommended that I try walking sticks.  I bought some at Walmart that were ineffective and not even usable, so I returned them.  Then I saw these on Amazon and, after reading the many positive reviews, decided to give them a try.  I am so glad I did.  They arrived on time and very well packaged in a slim carrying bag (which I may never use, but is nice to have just in case). The instructions were easy to follow, and adjusting the sticks is a breeze.  I practiced with them in our driveway and caught on how to use them quickly.  I know that I will be more likely to get the outdoor exercise I need if I am confident in my balance, and these walking sticks are a great help.  Finally, you just cannot beat the price.  I highly recommend this product.",0.988,189,17.181818181818183,0.7,2.5064
"This soccer ball is nearly full size, and when I field tested it on my seven-year-old cousin,it was an instant hit.  The ball is marketed to parents of younger children who are just beginning to play soccer and learning the game.  The Batman logo had great appeal to little Cousin Brandon, as Batman is one of his three favorite heroes.  The ball seems sturdy and well made, and the pump is nice to have so you don't have ot get out your air compressor.  Recommended for younger soccer players",0.9552,99,19.8,0.0,2.28656
"I ordered this product thinking that it would help when I walk the dog in the early morning or after work when it is dark.  It definitely does help because I do not have to carry a flashlight in addition to dealing with a hyper Jack Russell terrier.  However, it lacks the precision and flexibility of a flashlight.  I find myself twisting my head at odd angles to see what I want to focus on.  So it is not perfect.<br /><br />Having said that, I still like and recommend this product.  The light has two settings, and the brighter of the two is very bright.  It is comfortable to wear, even under a stocking cap against the winter winds.  It is fine most of the time, and I really cannot fault a product (this headlamp) for not being another product (a flashlight).  Most of the time, I really like it.  I have not used it for work under the car or tractor, but I imagine it would be good for that purpose as well.

So the bottom part of the rack is pretty sturdy but the pull up bar seems not sturdy at all. I’m able to do pull ups and chin ups but it kind feels not the most solid. I’m ok with that but the squeaking is horrible. A bad design for sure with the pull up bar. I’ve tried to tighten but no amount of torque helps.

So this thing works great and I really don’t think anyones bike will get ripped off if they use this properly. My only grip is even though it’s the lightest I shaped lock it’s pretty dark heavy and you’ll need to carry it in a backpack to transport it. I was thinking it could possible hang off the bike somewhere but of course it’s too bulky and heavy to really be safe doing it that way.

"This is more of a value glove, but definitely not a bottom shelf Franklin type...  $60ish for any glove is not going to last you very long and it's going to hurt a bit if you catch a heater.

Not a big deal just odd that it’s in there. I’d think it’s be better suited outside this zipper, but the designers must have though you’d want to tuck it away.

When my kids or wife use it there is little to no noise/vibrations at all. I'm thinking my extra weight is the cause and the fact that its on the second floor. It has all the same features as any treadmill I've been on with the added fan I've never seen, which is kind of nice and the speakers which are underwhelming for me but my kids (teens) like them. It folds upward very easily for extra room. Overall I'm pleased with this treadmills performance and features. Would easily recommend for users under 200 lbs or not using on the second floor.

My grandson took off around the neighborhood on this scooter within 5 minutes of opening the package. It comes fully assembled and you just need to connect the handles and unfold it. It rides smoothly and appears the same size as his razor A scooter. My grandson gives it 5 stars and says it rides more smoothly than his previous razor. We have owned probably 10 razor scooters over the past 5 years. Reason I took off a star was because the steering bar grinds a bit when you turn it. It only does it when you aren’t standing on it. When you stand on it it moves smoothly. Our razors aren’t like that. I reread the instructions to make sure I wasn’t missing a setup step.

"My granduaghters (3,7) both love LOL dolls so they were excited when this arrived. Instructions were easy to follow. Parts all came in good condition with no dents, scrapes or missing parts. Putting on the springs weren't as hard as I imagined. The last small screws that went in were the hardest and took a lot of elbow grease. Some of the very top horizontal curved bars face more inward than others so it was hard to tell which way they went. Could use a label since you can't tell until you have them up if they are the right direction. Overall I liked almost  everything about this, except the last part of tying the elastic straps on. There are A LOT of them and wasn't sure if I should be double knotting or single knotting them. Wish there was a better way to secure it than individually knotting all the straps. I was able to do almost all of the assembly by myself, but used some help when putting on the net. But I think one person could do it all just fine. Took about an hour and half to assemble. This is a good size if you have a small yard. Both granddaughters fit on it just fine even though it says one person only. It has good bounce to it as well. For the price, I would probably buy the 7ft little tikes trampoline without the LOL graphics or 7ft Best Choice trampoline. They are both almost $100 less expensive.",0.9869,281,15.61111111111111,0.3,1.9860700000000002
"I was expecting to open the box and find stuff dented, bent and scratched up, but somehow everything was in excellent condition. The directions are a little hard to follow since they are written for several different styles of bikes and this makes it really confusing. But once I got through most of putting it together I realized I probably could have figured it all out faster without looking at the manual that much. I also gathered all the tools required and sat down to put it together and one of the first things it says is to grease all the moving parts. I think grease should be listed as tools required for assembly. Overall it took about 40 min to assemble and once assembled I took it for a ride and think it’s a really nice bike. It is really comfortable to sit on and hold the handles. It feels really sturdy and not cheap. I did have to bend the fender a bit to keep it from rubbing on the wheel.",0.9206,186,20.666666666666668,0.1,2.30618

The Camelbak has also never leaked in his backpack which he also carries his iPad in, so leakage is very important. The Contigo didn't leak when I tested it out.

Five stars because of the quality of the magnets.  We've had other magnetic darts and they always bounce off the board because the magnets are too weak.  These things stick like glue.

"These are the simplest way to practice without bothering anyone else.  Plug in one wire and flip one switch and you're ready to go.  They also function as decent headphones without a guitar.  But overall they're medium-quality gear, which for $80 is fine.<br /><br />Sound quality with an American Standard Strat is a little tinny with not a huge amount of depth.  That clean Fender amp sound comes through but there's background hiss when the volume is above halfway.  Sound isolation is good and they're a big step up from the standard Apple gear when used with an iPhone.  There are audio clips on VOX's website to compare the different Amphone models.  The Twin is the least fatiguing on the ears.  You can get some crunch but not as much as the AC30 or Lead versions.  One has to wonder though - why can't all the amp models be put in one unit?<br /><br />They're built decently and I don't have any concerns about the skinny wire being damaged.  The wire also feels like the right length when sitting down with a strat or telecaster.  It is strange though that the wire connects to the left ear piece and not the right, where most people would plug in their guitars.  It has the usual pseudo-leather ear cushioning, and only weighs around eight ounces without the two AAA batteries installed.  The controls take some getting used to.  The dials are small and have a raised lip next to them.  There are four dials - effects, volume, tone and gain.  &#34;Effects&#34; controls three potential effects but only the delay seems worth using, and the range of the delay isn't very large.  There's a jack to connect a music player, which is a nice add-on but also means you have two wires leading up to your head.  You also need a 1/8th-to-1/8th inch wire to use it, as it's not included.<br /><br />You could just get a VOX Amplug and use other headphones with it, but it isn't made to fit a strat and I'm not sure I'd want one hanging from the bottom of my telecaster either.

Another unfortunate fact is ,because we waited until we were all together at our cabin to throw, we missed the window for return.

"I’m a little surprised that these yoga pants aren’t tighter , don’t get me wrong it’s not a horrible thing to have a pair of yoga pants that fit and actually stay up without cutting into your waist or wherever your thickest. It’s actually very nice .I suggest buying true to size or even downsizing. I purchased the black in an XL and could have bought the large (I wear a 14 pants )  the material is nice , soft yet a little thin .

I purchased this adorable hat for an out of town guest who would be attending a Reds baseball game with my husband and I... I was embarrassed to find that it was very shallow /small and would not sit correctly on her or even my own head. We are both average size adult females but honestly I don’t think it would even work for my tiny 14 year old granddaughter it’s just not deep enough from the band to the top of the hat . Very disappointed because it’s a very cute hat and I loved the style.,0.919,107,26.75,0.0,0.6757

"This is a very preliminary review, since I opened the box about 15 minutes ago. I want to clarify two things I have read in other reviews. First, you CAN turn the unit OFF by holding the SET button for five seconds. Second, the altimeter DOES show the measurement in FEET as well as meters. Follow the list of directions under Setting Step and you will see how to set feet as the unit of measure.<br /><br />So far so good on this unit. I fully expect it to work as it should. If anything changes to the contrary, I will update.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />After giving this item a genuine fair chance,  I returned it. Readings were not accurate: altimeter, compass, barometer. Date: accurate.  There must be a better alternative. I downloaded a compass app and it is 100% accurate. I'll stick with that.",0.9292,185,15.416666666666666,0.3,2.36876
"UODATE AUG 11. 2021:<br />The sports+ app required to update this watch has not worked in weeks. I have two of these watches now rendered useless. Be warned!!<br /><br />UPDATE: July 25, 2021:<br />The app, Sports+, that is required to make these watches work, has STOPPED working. This renders these watches useless. If you look at the app unfo on Google Play Store, you will see numerous complaints with no fix in sight. Very disappointing. I bought 3 of these in total, so I am waaaaay out of pocket.<br /><br />Things to Know:<br />Uses the app ""Sports+""  available free from Google Play Store. Download the app to help you set up the watch.<br />Turn on Bluetooth on the watch using the LIGHT button.<br />Thexset up process is a lot easier through the app.<br />The user manual is thorough.<br />The price is very reasonable.<br />Time keeping syncs to match your phone and is very accurate.<br />Appearance of the watch is a plus. Mine is red.<br /><br />The light for the dial  is not as bright as I would have liked.<br /><br />Overall a decent choice.<br /><br />UPDATE, MAY 2021<br />Well, I tried to change the battery vecause the light seemed dim to me. I made a sorry mistake. I would say DO NOT TRY to change the battery yourself. I cannot restore the watch to its original condition because there is simply too much to realign. I also ""lost"" two small screws that affix the back. My fault. A word to the wise.",-0.8444,362,21.294117647058822,0.8,0.38668
"Purchased this for my wife for Christmas, but I have given it to her early because she is concerned about heart rate and sleeping patterns.This review is a bit premature in light of the fact that I have yet to get any feedback from her on things life comfort and accuracy. But I thought I would try to help out others who are considering purchase of this item.<br /><br />1. So far, out of the box it seems to be working properly.<br />2. There is no manual with the item. I found one on the Amazon site as part of the item description. If you wish to print the manual, the needed part is 19 pp.<br />3. You have the choice of using the fitbit with a smartphone or a puter. My wife is using it with her phone, which makes it highly portable with stats available on the phone app.<br />4. The battery in the unit is apparently NOT replaceable -- at least the manual offers no info on this point.<br />5. With normal use, the batt charge will last for 5 days. It can be recharged only one way, via USB port on a puter. There is no power cord, other than the USB cord that comes with the unit. I charged it and it took about an hour to reach full charge.<br />6. Now this is important if you don't want to wind up torturing yourself, as happened to me: REMOVE the piece of plastic that covers the watch crystal on the fitbit. The plastic piece is black and has a useless number on it. When you do the phone setup, the pairing with bluetooth will provide you with a 4-digit code. You cannot see the code unless you remove that piece of plastic protector.<br /><br />Once my wife lets me know how the unit is doing, I will update this review with additional info. I hope you find this preliminary info helpful!",0.8661,391,21.72222222222222,0.0,2.25983
"The main purpose of these lights is to enable you to be seen. They do that job very well. They are very lightweight. The clip on easily to coat or hat. Units come with two replacement batts and a screwdriver. All very good.<br /><br />The units also come with two velcro straps that I am not sure how to use. They are very small, so you cannot wrap them around your arms. Perhaps they are meant for fingers? I am clueless on this feature.<br /><br />I bought these for dog walking after almost being hit by a car. I am glad i did, because I can tell that drivers slow down now when they are alerted by these safety lights.",0.7529,147,14.7,0.0,1.82587
"This is a nifty stopwatch for those who want a very basic timepiece. It has three buttons: STOP, CLEAR, GO. I received the blue-purple watch (you cannot choose the combo you want) with red, yellow, and green buttons. If you put this stopwatch in your pocket, you will most likely hit the GO button unintentionally. They are very sensitive buttons. The watch cannot be turned off, I have no idea how long the LR44 battery will last.<br /><br />The watch is a bit large, but it makes the numbers very easy to read. IMHO it is a bit pricey for such a simple device. If you are looking for a stopwatch to keep you motivated and you don't want to be tormented by those tiny hard-to-push buttons on the stopwatch feature  of your digital wristwatch, this may be the stopwatch for you. It is so simple to use it makes me want to use it. It gets me out the door and walking. Life is good!",0.936,198,18.0,1.2,2.2408
"I had purchased this as a Christmas gift, but my wife thought she might be allergic to the chest strap. So I am using it. The watch and chest strap are well made. Here are some things you should know:<br /><br />1. you must use the chest strap. You get no heart/pulse rate readings on the watch without it. The chest strap is easy on, easy off.<br />2. once you affix the chest strap, you will forget you have it on.<br />3. you need to wet a portion of the chest strap before applying it for the day. I simply put a swipe of water on each part of the strap on either side of the Timex logo. You only need do this once per day, or so I have found.<br />4. while you can change the battery in the chest strap yourself, the manual recommends a professional change the watch battery.<br />5. the manual itself requires some close attention if you are to get the full benefit of the monitor. I am still figuring out all of the bells and whistles.<br />6. the recorded HR on this watch matches the treadmill HR monitor at the gym as well as our BP machine.<br /><br />When I read that other reviewers bought this item based on their heart doctor's suggestion, I thought that was good enough for me. My wife's loss is my gain (smile)!<br /><br />UPDATE, March 14,2013<br />I continue to enjoy the use of this product immensely. Note that when you are not using the HR monitor feature, it serves as a timepiece. And finally, a note to those who, like me, are hearing impaired. On the first day I used this monitor, I went to see my hearing aid dispenser for a check-up. He immediately said, ""What's beeping?"" I said, is it my phone? He said no, it seems to be coming from . . . there. He meant the monitor on my wrist! I myself could not hear it a lick! So: if you see a tiny chime icon on the watch face in monitor mode, then anyone close to you can hear what I surmise are rhythmic beeps. The chime feature can be turned off, as I discovered after I spent a half-day announcing my presence to the world!",0.9889,481,16.586206896551722,0.2,2.35667
"My wife and I are ""seasoned citizens"" who just got back into a workout program at the local YMCA. To keep our motivation at the highest level, I thought it would be a good idea to be able to chart our progress on a regular basis -- enter two pedometers! We are also able to post our daily results online by way of a major drug store chain, so that helps with motivation as well!<br /><br />Now to the pedometer:<br />1. to us, it is excellent in every way. It keeps track of your daily steps, it resets itself to zero at midnight, and it saves seven days' worth of results for your review;<br />2. it clips to your belt or pants very securely thanks to the clip into which the pedometer fits. So far we have found no need to attach the small strap that comes with the pedometer;<br />3. although the pedometer is ""always on"" once you insert the battery, that does not seem to be a problem; it takes the CR2032 battery readily available in stores;<br />4. the numbers are easy to read if you have ""older"" eyes;<br />5. the pedometer is a little longer than 2"" -- not large at all, just the right size;<br />6. the pedometer keeps track of routine walking AND specific aerobic movement, such as walking on a treadmill; the total number includes the aerobic steps, but the aerobic steps are shown separately -- a nice feature.<br /><br />We are very glad we have our pedometers.

These cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as “foam” grips.<br /><br />The price (about $10 on Amazon) is outrageous.

Despite its small size, it projects a powerful, extremely bright, focused light beam that travels a considerable distance.<br /><br />The on/off button cycles through three modes:  bright, low, strobe.  The metal case has a notched ring around the opening for the light beam, making the flashlight into a “tactical” one (suitable for breaking glass).  The flashlight works with AA batteries--two powerful “Energizer Max” AA batteries are included.  (The flashlight works with regular AA batteries, but the beam isn’t as bright.)<br /><br />As with larger tactical flashlights, the handle (battery case) becomes quite warm if the flashlight stays on for long.

"This GAIAM RESTORE STRETCH BAND STRAP (with Loops for Medium Resistance) is handy to have around as a workout accessory, but it doesn’t offer much in the way of resistance.  For me, it helps a little with a couple of rehab hip stretches: (1) a knee-toward-the-shoulder stretch; and (2) an across-the-body leg stretch that requires holding my leg with a strap or leg lifter.<br /><br />You need to be careful with this item.  It comes with some safety warnings, and with a nice chart of exercises (8 exercises in all).  However, I tweaked a muscle in my left thigh when I was trying a right-leg stretch that requires running the strap along your back from foot to hand (hand extended above shoulder).  I should have read the instructions more carefully before I tried to get the strap into the correct position.<br /><br />The band is well made.

The ball arrives deflated (of course!), but the kit includes a pump.  You can also use a bicycle pump to inflate it.<br /><br />The progressive resistance bands are useful.  If you’ve ever had a course of physical therapy (e.g., after breaking a bone), you know that resistance bands come in different colors because they require different amounts of strength to stretch and use them.  It’s good to have on hand a set of bands like the ones in this kit, so that you can progress from “easy” to “hard” as your workout builds your strength.<br /><br />The kit includes a downloadable guide with exercises you can do with this kit.

"This THERABAND RESISTANCE BAND LOOP SET (Pack of Four 8-Inch Loops) consists of four short (8”) elastic bands that provide four different levels of resistance for use in rehabilitation or workout exercises.  Yellow requires the least amount of strength for expansion; blue, the most.<br /><br />The resistance in these bands seems to be the same as the resistance you get when you purchase lengths of yellow, red, green, and blue therapeutic elastic in a medical supply store.  It’s nice to have a set of the different-colored bands, because you are expected to move from lower to higher resistance as your strength improves with regular exercise.<br /><br />While it’s convenient to purchase the elastic in loops--so you don’t have to knot the material to use it--you do need bands that are the right length for you.  These bands are only 8” long when laid flat (there is a total of 16” of material).  Thus they are far too short for adult use, and I wonder whether they are long enough for use by any but very small children.<br /><br />The bands arrive wrapped around a brochure that has excellent explanations and photos of various exercises that can be done with resistance bands.

"The smallest DAY 1 FITNESS WEIGHTED WORKOUT BAR (5 lbs., 48” long, padded foam, solid steel) is a good choice if you’re just starting to work out with body bars.  The long, 5-lb. bar feels surprisingly heavy, when you begin doing squats, lunges, and overhead lifts with the bar in your hands.<br /><br />A weighted bar--basically a barbell bar with the weight evenly distributed through the bar--takes up a lot less space than a dumbbell set, a barbell weight set, or a weight-training machine; and it’s extremely versatile.  You can use a weighted bar in your conditioning, flexibility, and strength-training routines to get improved results.  (To find many videos and suggestions for using body bars safely, just Google for “how to use weighted bars”.)<br /><br />This Day 1 Fitness body bar seems to live up to the seller’s “heavy duty” claim.

If you only have a door available, you might prefer the more vertical [[ASIN:B07KK4HPJ8 life-size “Steph Curry shooting” decal]].<br /><br />Because of its size, the beautiful, full-color photographic decal is a bit of a challenge to install--it’s best to have two people available for the job.

Be sure to clean your wall first, to make any required repositioning easier.<br /><br />It goes without saying that any serious Golden State Warriors fan will love this wall decal featuring the unselfish, likeable Curry, who is generally regarded as the greatest shooter of all time.<br /><br />Note that the jersey displays the 2018-2019 team logo.  A slightly different logo (with an altered bridge) was adopted for the team’s move from Oakland to San Francisco.

(The only parts to attach are two base stabilizers and the pedals.)<br /><br />Second, the console with the readout and the power, speed, and mode buttons is actually a wired remote that you can hold in your hand as you use the “exerciser”.<br /><br />After those two things, it is all bad news.<br /><br />+++Even for a fit person, it is hard to insert your feet under the pedal straps.  (The Velcro-adjustable straps are essential for keeping your feet on the pedals during exercise.)  Worse, the straps are too short to go around my husband’s size 12 shoes.<br /><br />+++The exerciser weighs only 10 lbs. It “walked away” from my chair so badly, I couldn’t even complete 2 minutes of pedaling.  This was true when I placed it on a rubber mat (not included).  Bracing the device against a wall to hold it in front of my chair didn’t work, because it just shifted sideways.<br /><br />+++The motor is extremely weak (110 V), and just moves the pedals around and around at slightly different speeds, in forward or reverse directions.  The pedals move your feet and legs up and down, but you don’t really get any meaningful exercise, because you aren’t causing the pedals to move.  There Is no way to adjust resistance to make it easier or harder to pedal.  The device offers no feedback on your own expended effort.<br /><br />I purchased the device for my disabled husband to use to build endurance, and it’s a complete disaster.  He can’t keep his feet on the pedals, and he can’t sustain even a brief period of sustained “pedaling”, because the device immediately moves forward away from his chair.",-0.5123,448,32.0,2.0,0.84631
"This PLANET FITNESS MUSCLE MASSAGER FOAM ROLLER (for Deep Tissue Massage, Back, Trigger Point Therapy, Grey) has a hard plastic core covered with a bumpy hard rubber wrap.  There is a slight give to the rubber, so it doesn’t feel like you’re rolling over rocks.  The roller is NOT a “foam” roller, which is a good thing.  I particularly like the low area in the middle, which exempts your spine from the stimulation of the rubber bumps.<br /><br />Personally, I find all massage rollers hard to use, because you need to set up properly, and then roll your body over the device.

The care instructions say “spot clean only”, though I think the fabric will stand up to machine washing.

(The carrier is a tube of fabric rather than a flap or strap, so it won’t fit really big, thick mats--not even the [[ASIN:B07H9PZDQW Gaiam thick yoga mat]].)<br /><br />The tote is extremely well made.  It also comes with a clip-on shoulder strap.",0.9298,212,30.285714285714285,0.0,2.27894
"Like other Star Brite products that I’ve tried, this STAR BRITE ONE STEP TEAK CLEANER & BRIGHTENER (32 ounce) works extremely well.  I was a little uncertain about using it on my solid teak dining room table, but it was effective without causing damage.  It removed dirt and old oil without heavy scrubbing, and really brightened up the appearance of the wood.  (You will want to oil your teak furniture again after using this cleaner.)<br /><br />The teak cleaner contains oxalic acid, and carries a warning that it is corrosive.  However, it is odorless.  It doesn’t give off unpleasant fumes when you’re working with it, and it doesn’t leave any unpleasant smell behind.",0.5118,145,20.714285714285715,0.2,2.21354
"In my experience, Gaiam products never disappoint--they’re expensive, but the quality always lives up to the price.  This GAIAM SOL ROUND YOGA BOLSTER PILLOW (for Meditation, Yoga, Pilates & Relaxation) is no exception.  The soft gray outer cover is made of heavy, tightly-woven microfiber fabric, and has a handle-strap on one end that makes it easy to lift and move the entire pillow.<br /><br />The bolster pillow itself is firm but NOT hard; big but NOT too heavy.  It’s the perfect accessory for yoga exercises that help to manage my chronic hip and back pain.",0.9051,121,30.25,0.0,2.27153
"This ADIDAS ORIGINALS SANTIAGO LUNCH BAG is a lunch bag designed for adults!  It looks more like a shoe bag than a lunch bag, and it’s very large and roomy.  It has two zippered food compartments, both lined with a silver material that helps keep cold foods cold.<br /><br />The main compartment will hold as many as two 33.8 fl. oz. water bottles.  The small compartment is about 1” thick, and will easily hold a sandwich, or a few small plastic food containers.  The mesh pocket on the back will easily hold napkins and plastic utensils.<br /><br />The bag is made of durable, tightly woven polyester fabric.  There is plastic piping around the two zippered compartments to reinforce the seams.  The stitching is even and solid.  In sum, this is a well-made, well-thought-out lunch bag.",0.8775,169,16.9,0.0,2.26325
"This 18” GAIAM SELF-GUIDED FOAM ROLLER is a really useful, compact exercising aid.  It consists of a hard plastic foam core, surrounded by a rubber sheet that’s printed with clear instructions for performing nine common roller moves.  Each printed set of instructions is accompanied by a drawing that shows the correct positioning.<br /><br />The instructions are sufficient for performing the moves, even if, like me, you’ve never used a hard foam roller before.  However, I strongly recommend that you visit the Gaiam website (address is on the packaging) and view some of the wonderful (free) foam roller exercise videos before you start, if you’re a newbie.  It’s possible to hurt yourself if you don’t use the roller correctly—it can be tricky to get into the correct position, to roll in the right direction, and to NOT slip off the roller.  This is especially true if your muscles are tight.<br /><br />The roller has a strong chemical smell when it first comes out of the packaging.  I think that this will dissipate with time (probably in a few days).  For now, my roller is stored in the garage to air out.<br /><br />About 18 months ago, I broke my leg.  Rehab folks put together a stretching routine that has helped me recover full use of the leg.  However, my hip still tightens up, so I’m looking forward to fixing that problem with the Gaiam roller exercises.",0.9401,298,29.8,0.3,2.3720299999999996
"Where I live, it’s cool year-round, with only occasional hot days that make you wish for air conditioning.  Thus I know the hot-day trick of soaking a terry cloth washrag in cold water and putting it on your head (especially at night) to cool off, when fans aren’t enough to combat the heat.  The water evaporates from the washrag, and has a substantial cooling effect.<br /><br />This AFFINITY ARCTIC BREEZE COOLING TOWEL works the same way, but it’s better than a washrag.  First, it’s bigger—a large rectangle the size of a sports towel.  Second, it seems to stay cold longer.  Third, the rectangular shape lets you wrap it around your neck or head, to keep it in place.  Fourth, the smooth, silky fabric is soothing by itself.<br /><br />The Affinity cooling towel is easy care.  Machine wash warm; air dry flat (do NOT tumble dry).",0.964,191,23.875,0.0,2.2892
"This SENDA VITORIA DUOTECH FUTSAL SOCCER BALL (Fair Trade Certified, Red/Gray, Size 4 (Ages 13 & Up)) appears to be very well made.  I like the tough, textured exterior surface; it feels almost like leather.<br /><br />Be sure you have a bicycle pump and inflation needle on hand, because it arrives only partially inflated.  The bright red-and-blue color scheme is pleasing to the eye.<br /><br />I use this size 4 soccer ball as a rehabilitation aid—several of my PT exercises for back/hip muscle strengthening call for gripping a ball between the knees during the exercise.  A ball with an inflatable bladder is ideal for PT equipment, because you can pump the ball up to your ideal softness/hardness level.",0.9812,146,36.5,0.0,2.29436

"This UST HERITAGE LENSATIC COMPASS is beautiful, with its liquid-filled needle capsule, and its polished brass case.  It’s fairly heavy (4.7 oz.), so it may not be the best choice for backpacking, but it’s a great learning compass.<br /><br />To use it, the first step is to hold it level, so that the needle swings freely without touching the sides of the capsule.  The second step is to make sure there is no metal (e.g., a hunting knife) or magnetic field nearby, as either will affect the needle direction and prevent an accurate reading.  The third step is to let the needle “settle” before you take your reading.<br /><br />The box says there are complete instructions for use inside—NOT true, but the Ultimate Survival Technologies web site has an excellent one-page PDF that gives two methods for using the compass to sight distant objects and determine directions. “Lensatic” means that the compass has a prismatic lens for reading the outer (mils/milliradians) or inner (degrees) scales and determining the bearing or azimuth.  This lens really works—it magnifies the scale figures.<br /><br />The luminous directional letters and sighting lines also work.  The “hanging loop” is actually a thumb loop that helps you steady the compass as you sight with it.  My brass case has a few tiny nicks and pits on the bottom and on the lens pivot, but the brass cover is pristine and gorgeous.  I polish the case with Brasso.<br /><br />Once you have this compass, you can learn all about navigation.  Start by looking up “Compass” on Wikipedia, and it will lead you to many fascinating online articles.",0.9886,340,30.90909090909091,0.3,2.38658
"This BALLISTIC FOOTBALL (Neon, Size 6) is a cute little toy football for small hands.  It's a toy because of the small size, and because of the “seams” and “laces” that are just molded plastic.  The pebbled surface is very easy to grip. The neon stripes on the ends are easy to see when the ball is thrown.<br /><br />The ball is already inflated when it arrives.  You can add air easily by using a bicycle pump and an inflator needle.  The ball measures 17-3/4&#34; from tip to tip (measuring along the ball's surface).  “Ballistic” is the brand name (not a new or different kind of football).",0.8883,141,20.142857142857142,0.0,2.26649
"This CONTIGO AUTOSEAL CHILL STAINLESS STEEL WATER BOTTLE (24 oz, Monaco) really does keep water cold for 24 hours!  It has a wide mouth, so you can put ice cubes directly into the bottle, if you like.  It's beautiful--all stainless steel, except for the Autoseal cap.  (In the &quot;Monaco&quot; colorway, the cap is navy blue, dark gray, and white.)<br /><br />The Contigo Autoseal cap doesn't leak, unless the big button is depressed.  To guard against accidental depression when the bottle is carried in a tote bag or backpack, there is a little lid that swings down to cover the spout.  (The lid swings back into the cap and lies flat if you don't need it.) The cap also has a small, swing-up, carrying handle.<br /><br />The 24-ounce bottle is a very convenient size.  It's portable, but holds enough that it doesn't require frequent refilling.  You can easily drink from the bottle, using only one hand.  The bottle has a spout opening, so you can drink big gulps as long as you hold the big button down--unlike water bottles that have straw openings requiring suction for drinking.<br /><br />The cap is easily rinsed, and is top-rack dishwasher safe.  The stainless steel body is easily rinsed, and easily hand washed.  (I think that hand-washing is recommended for the body because dishwasher detergent can pit or discolor stainless steel.)<br /><br />NOTE BEFORE YOU BUY:  This bottle should be used only for cold, non-pulpy, non-carbonated drinks.  Carbonated and hot liquids can create internal pressure resulting in discharge of liquid and possible injury.  Pulpy liquids can clog the drink spout.",0.9648,351,21.9375,0.7,2.49944
"I love this ridiculously big POLAR BOTTLE &quot;BLUE BIG BEAR&quot; 42-OUNCE INSULATED WATER BOTTLE!  It's easy to grip, even when filled with water and ice, because of the pinched &quot;waist&quot; in the middle.  The wide mouth allows you to drop in (rather than squeeze in) whole ice cubes, which makes filling the bottle frustration-free.  It has a spill-resistant squeeze top that is easy to open and to drink from. (The valve is removable for thorough cleaning, as desired.)<br /><br />What I needed was a really big water bottle to keep by my TV-watching chair.  With this one, I can fill it daily with filtered tap water, and never need to refill it during my evening programs. It's big, but it fits under the kitchen faucet (when held at an angle).  The bottle has a carrying ring that makes it easy to transport around the house.<br /><br />My &quot;Blue Big Bear&quot; bottle doesn't look quite as good as the product photo.  The graphic is printed on a slightly crumpled liner that's inside a cloudy plastic exterior.  Thus it takes good light at the correct angle for the graphic to show up well, and for the bottle to look really blue.  However, I never liked the graphic to begin with, so I don't care about the looks.<br /><br />This giant water bottle does keep drinks cold.  If you need a high-capacity bottle, it's a good choice.",0.9468,309,23.76923076923077,0.1,2.31404
"This KATE SPADE NY BLACK SCALLOP ACTIVITY TRACKER is dressy, and never needs charging (because it's powered by a coin battery), but it's definitely an &#34;activity tracker lite&#34;.  All it does for &#34;activity&#34; is track steps, calories (as computed by an algorithm), distance, and a few goals (e.g., sleep, daily water glasses).  It also has a countdown to important events (birthdays, etc.) feature that gives notifications.<br /><br />The Quick Start guide is unhelpful.  It tells you to download the companion app to your smartphone, and has diagrams for inserting the supplied battery in the watch.  The downloaded app tells you how to register for an online account that will actually keep track of your data.  The reviews of the app in the Google Play store report that the app is flaky, and may wipe your data.<br /><br />The watchband is cheap, made of rubber (though it doesn't actually look cheap).  This &#34;activity tracker&#34; is basically a toy.  I'm sticking with my [[ASIN:B00N2BW2PK Fitbit Charge HR]], which isn't pretty or dressy, but is a serious activity tracker that does much, much more, including telling the time and date.",0.607,270,30.0,0.8,1.2221
"Ankle weights are a valuable, versatile addition to anyone's exercise routine.  Weights add resistance to repetitions, helping to further strengthen and tone the specific muscles targeted by repeated simple exercises.  These GAIAM WELLBEING ANKLE WEIGHTS (5lb Set) are extremely well-made, with solid stitching, and plenty of good, heavy-duty Velcro that makes them easy to strap on and holds them firmly in place.<br /><br />I use mine in a rehab routine that rebuilds muscle strength in a repaired broken leg.  The 2.5 lb. weight on each ankle is quite manageable for an active woman in good health.  These can also be used as hand-held weights (instead of soup cans) in arm-muscle-strengthening exercises.",0.9582,134,22.33333333333333,0.2,2.34746
"STAR BRITE XTREME CLEAN ALL-SURFACE CLEANER/DEGREASER is terrific stuff!  It solved a problem that had defeated everything I tried.  It quickly removed all the surface rust and gunk from a metal commode frame that had developed rust spots where water splattered and corroded the chrome tubing.  Not even Windex would clean that chrome frame; but this Xtreme Clean worked in seconds!  Now the chrome looks shiny and new where it's not already corroded, and the entire metal frame surface is clean.<br /><br />Xtreme Clean comes in a plastic bottle with a spray top (Off, Spray, Stream).  You don't want to get it in your eyes, and you should wash it off if you get it on your hands, but in general it seems to be safe and non-toxic.  Most household cleaners that are as effective as Xtreme Clean one have a multi-page label with lots of scary use and storage warnings.<br /><br />This is a product that I'll be reordering often, because it does an excellent job on that previously-impossible-to-clean commode frame.  I'm sure that I'll find lots of other uses for it, too.",0.981,221,27.625,0.0,2.2943
"Wow, what a monster!  This ULTIMATE BODY PRESS WALL-MOUNTED DOORWAY PULL UP BAR is a serious piece of exercise equipment--the bar measures 4 inches around.  This allows a solid, comfortable, non-tiring grip for large hands.  A heavy duty pull up bar like this one is an excellent choice if you have limited space for exercise equipment--you can use it for resistance band exercises as well as for pull ups.<br /><br />But the bar does require a fair amount of space (an over door space about 38 inches wide).  You mount the bar on the solid ""king studs"" located about 3 inches on each side of most interior doorways.  Thus you will need a doorway that allows you to reach those studs.  Some of my condo's doorways are set flush against an interior wall on one side, and are totally unsuitable for mounting this bar.<br /><br />Also, you need ceilings that are high enough to allow you some headroom for pull ups.  My condo has 8 foot ceilings, and most of the doorways leave 15 inches above the opening.  This is enough room, but just barely.  If you use the bar for resistance band training, you need adequate space to move around in front of the doorway, too.<br /><br />The installation hardware (lag bolts and washers) is included.  However, you will need some tools in order to install the bar--an electronic stud finder, a level, a power drill, a 5/16"" drill bit, a socket drive adapter for the power drill (optional but recommended), a 17mm socket wrench, and a 17mm open socket wrench.  The sheet of installation instructions (in English) is extremely clear and easy to follow.",0.9712,343,28.58333333333333,0.8,2.5313600000000003
"This 8-1/2 ounce MARINEX GLASS CUSTARD CUP is slightly larger than the small Pyrex custard cups that I've always used for baked custard.  However, it's still a very convenient size for single servings of custard, pudding, or ice cream.<br /><br />The Marinex brand is expensive, but superior to the present-day Pyrex brand, because Marinex glass cookware is made from borosilicate glass.  Borosilicate glass, which has a slight green tinge, is less susceptible to thermal shock than the tempered soda lime glass used by Pyrex.  (Years ago, Pyrex dishes were also made of borosilicate glass.)  I feel safer using glass cookware made with borosilicate glass, because some of my newer Pyrex dishes have shattered when they were removed from the oven and placed on a room-temperature, ceramic-tile countertop.  (Now I always place glass cookware on a hotpad or oven mitt.)<br /><br />When I ordered this item, I thought that the listing must be for four Marinex custard cups, because of the price (about $16).  In fact, I received just one custard cup, as the listing promises.  The single custard cup is a genuine Marinex custard cup, and it is identical to the ones in the four-cup set that I purchased from Amazon for about the same price (see [[ASIN:B008H07AQC Marinex Set of Four Glass Custard Cups, 8-1/2-Ounce]]).  Because this is a 5-star product with a 1-star price, I rate it at 3 stars (""It's okay"" on the official Amazon scale).",0.8674,302,30.2,0.2,1.5202200000000001

As a result, I cannot use my legs to push me up from a seated position and I am not stable in trying to get up. Camping chairs are generally not sturdy and sink in the sitting area. Not this chair.

"There are a lot of great things about this scooter, with one significant bad (which I think was a fluke in our case, but definitely affected my opinion).<br />Good: the colors and graphics are cute, but not too childish or annoying. The textured base is perfect for keeping your child's riding foot in place. The size is just right, and I love that it will adjust as my granddaughter grows. She's really excited about it, and has had fun learning how to use it.<br />BAD: one of the handle tubes was too big for where it needed to be inserted into the frame. The whole scooter comes assembled, but broken down - you flip a lever to raise the long frame from the base, and you pull the handles out of an attached clip and then insert them into the metal tube (there is a photo on the product page of the collapsed scooter). I was totally confused, but checked and double-checked - one of the handles was both bigger than the other handle, and just too big too fit. SO...we had to laboriously file down the metal on the handle and the tube in order to even make it work. Even so, we didn't get it filed down enough to pull it back out (wrenching into place was really tough), so that side won't be able to collapse now. I do like the scooter, but when you need to fix a manufacturing flaw to get something to work, it's disappointing.",0.8588,297,33.0,0.4,1.5776400000000002
"I wish I had these when my son was younger! As a small child, he was very sensitive to noise, and we would have to bring regular over-the-ear headphones (long, awkward cord and all) to places like the movie theater so he could watch a film without being terrified of the noise. He also had problems during long trips dealing with so many public bathrooms and their loud automatic toilets and hand dryers, etc.<br /><br />These noise protection ear muffs would have been so useful then, but even still, they will come in handy. He's 7 now, and will still be able to use them when we go to the air show, concerts, or any other place where the sounds aren't really scary to him now, just inappropriately loud.<br /><br />The description here says 6 months-adult, but the box it came in says 6 months-10 years, and that's definitely the proper size. I cannot imagine an adult trying to wear these; even at 7yo, these are pretty snug on my son. But they are also comfortable, and I'm impressed that they block out loud noises, but he can still manage to hear smaller, ambient noises, included me talking to him (though, of course, it's muffled). What I mean is these aren't noise-cancelling, per se, so he's not constantly hollering &#34;WHAT?&#34; while wearing them.<br /><br />The one drawback on these is the the hinging. The unit is sprung so tightly, and the hinging on each ear is so awkward, that it makes my son (and me, honestly) a little nervous.

"I am not by any means a connoisseur of tension bands. In fact, I was hoping this would be a good, entry level way to begin resistance training. I can definitely feel the muscles being exercised while using this band, but I find the band a little unwieldy to hold on to. Other reviews mentioned how helpful it is to be able to change hand positioning to increase/reduce tension, but - for me - the webbing is neither comfortable to fit my hand into nor to hold on to. And it's made from the kind of material that picks up *every* bit of debris. My son dropped it on the floor, and now I'm trying to pull and wash pet hair off this band. Not fun.

It comes in a plastic bag and is quite stiff out of the box, but it works as described and holds weights without issue (I've only tried up to 25 lbs on the chain).<br /><br />My biggest complaint is how stiff it is and how you kind of need to bend it to get it around your back, but I think that will get better with time.",0.4588,107,35.666666666666664,0.0,1.73764

"I've tried several paddles and this is up there with my favorites. It has an elongated style with a 5.75"" grip, which is the longest of any paddle I've tried. I personally would prefer a slightly shorter handle, but that is just my preference. I swing with one hand, but the longer grip is perfect for people who swing with both hands.<br /><br />This paddle is among the thicker and heavier paddles I've used. It's 16mm and weighs ~8.5 oz. One of the first things I noticed when using this is the large sweet spot. I didn't expect an elongated paddle to have such a large sweet spot, so it was a welcomed surprised. The carbon fiber used in this paddle is supposedly 66% stronger than the carbon fiber used in most other pickleball paddles, but I couldn't tell a difference.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great paddle with a longer grip, this is it!",0.9874,193,24.125,0.1,1.92622
"These gloves are decent. In terms of comfort and warmth, these are fine. My biggest bone to pick is that the gloves require non-standard batteries and charger. Other heated gloves/vests I've tried have all been powered by USB power banks, and you can use any USB power bank. These gloves, however, come with their own batteries and are charged via a DC port (I think that's what it's called). USB power banks, wall plugs, etc. are very common these days, so it's easy to find a charger. With these, if you lose them, you might as well buy a new pair of gloves. For this reason alone, I would skip these.<br /><br />In terms of functionality, these work great. They are comfortable, heat up quickly, and get to a good range of temperatures. The gloves also have a stylish design. Another thing that I liked about these is that they aren’t SO big/puffy, like most heated gloves.<br /><br />These would be 4 star gloves if they used a more common battery pack/charger. But because of the non-standard battery/charger, I can't recommend these.",0.8466,233,17.923076923076923,0.0,1.0539800000000001

Just to mention, the box these came in came squished, so you if you thinking about getting these as a gift, be aware. Didn't bother me, but figured I'd mention.",0.8108,112,16.0,0.0,2.24324
"While this bag is on the more expensive side, it's a good one. My first observation was that the bag was bigger than I expected. It has several different pockets ranging from a ""hidden"" accessory pocket along the back of the backpack (for phones, etc.), to the main pocket for your paddles, to a bottle pocket. Not the mention the larger accessory pocket and medium-sized misc. pocket.<br /><br />In the main pocket, I'd guess you could fit 3, maybe 4 paddles. Definitely at least 2 without any issues. Also Inside the main pocket, there is a fence hook, which is a nice touch.<br /><br />In the ""middle"" pocket (in between the larger accessory pocket and the main pocket, there is room for some balls + more (I'm thinking grip tape, lead tape, etc.). The zippers on all the pockets feel like your average zippers and I would assume they'd hold up well over time.<br /><br />While this is definitely on the pricier side of pickleball backpacks, I do find it to be pretty nice. Definitely has enough room for all your stuff and feels like a quality bag. I'm expecting this to hold up for a while. Overall, I like it!",0.9821,261,21.83333333333333,0.0,2.29463
"I like this bottle for a few reasons. First of all, it looks great, duh. Second of all, I really like that it comes with 2 lids, 3 straws, and a cleaning brush (!). The brush is great because I've had a few straws get gross because I couldn’t clean them beyond running soapy water through them.<br /><br />Physically, it is comfortable to hold and the koozie is a nice touch as well. I've taken this bottle to work out with a few times, and it keeps my water cold for hours (I haven't tested it with warm liquids). I'd recommend this bottle.",0.975,133,22.166666666666668,0.0,2.2925
"I like this paddle a lot. It has a 4"" grip (length), is 15.5"" tall and 8.5"" wide. It also isn't super heavy, coming in at ~8 oz.<br /><br />The grip has a circumference of 4.5"" and is comfortable to hold over longer periods of play (2+ hours). The grip is pretty tacky and sweat absorbent. It's a widebody paddle, which allows for a bigger sweet spot, which is great. The face is also made of carbon fiber (Toray T700, if that means anything), which allows for a lot of spin. In my games, I noticed more spin when I was serving and more top spin when hitting it forehand. The paddle also comes with a nice sleeve, which is a nice touch. The grittiness on the face will inevitably fade with use, so it's nice they give a sleeve to keep it safe when not playing. Additionally, the entire face is covered with plastic when you receive it, ensuring it is actually untouched until you begin playing with it.<br /><br />This is quickly becoming one of my favorite paddles! Looking forward to continuing to play with it.",0.9873,237,21.545454545454547,0.2,1.95619
"I am a big fan of this knife. It's sharp, has a high-quality construction, and is small enough to easily carry around all day.<br /><br />It comes in a nice presentation box, which opens up the possibility of giving this as a gift (which I would have loved).<br /><br />The knife itself isn't huge (see pics), but it feels very high-quality. It is made of stainless steel and fiberglass, and did not have any imperfections when I received it. It has a little thumb piece on both sides of the blade so that you can open it with your thumb, which is pretty satisfying. The blade is very sharp out of the box and I haven't had any trouble cutting anything open (boxes, etc.).<br /><br />Overall, I've been super impressed with this and would absolutely get it again.

"This set has everything you need to get started--two rackets, 3 balls, 2 overgrips, and a carrying case.<br /><br />I am not a tennis expert, but the rackets feel nice and the strings were tight. They were not too heavy and felt pretty forgiving.<br /><br />The 3 included balls did not feel as nice as the ""traditional"" branded balls (Wilson, Penn, etc.), but that is to-be-expected, given everything that is included in this set.<br /><br />Overall, I have no complaints about this set. If you're looking for a good beginner's tennis set, this is a great one.",0.9606,140,35.0,0.0,2.28818
"This is an OK paddle. I don't love it, I don't hate it. I think my favorite thing about this paddle is the colorful design on the paddle face.<br /><br />The face itself has almost no texture/grit, which as a brand new player may not matter, but will quickly become important after you get the hang of hitting the ball. The paddle face is approximately ~0.5 inches (~13 mm), which is on the thinner side. The upside of a thin paddle is that it provides more power than a thicker paddle, but on the downside, it will be tougher to spin with it (which is compounded by the fact the paddle face has no texture).<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like was the handle--it feels flat, like a piece of wood. Round handles are much more comfortable in my experience. The grip, however, was pretty nice. It is soft and comfortable to hold, and absorbs sweat pretty well. An added bonus with this paddle is that it comes with a paddle cover. Not a huge deal, but a nice touch nonetheless.<br /><br />My bottom line is that this is a decent first paddle. Otherwise, I would pass.",0.9874,251,22.818181818181817,0.0,1.49622
"So this is Ben Johns' new paddle after switching over from Franklin. I really like this paddle.<br /><br />The first things that stick out to me are grit on the paddle face and the nice grip.<br /><br />The face of this paddle is carbon fiber, unlike the fiberglass face on his previous paddle. Carbon fiber is more durable and allows for more spin than fiberglass. The grit on the face is immediately apparent when you touch it--it might be the grittiest paddle I've felt. I've noticed that I can actually get some extra spin if I use my wrist more when hitting the ball (which I probably shouldn't be doing).<br /><br />Another aspect I really like is the grip. The grip is not completely flat like most grips, but has a nice texture to it. It absorbs sweat well and it's held up pretty well over the few weeks I've been using it so far.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic paddle designed by the world's best player. If you can stomach the premium price (or are a high-level player), get this!",0.9823,236,29.5,0.0,1.89469
"No complaints with these balls. They work well outside and bounce as expected. They are, however, softer than other outdoor pickleballs I've tried.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish these were seamless. I am a casual pickleballer, so this doesn't bother me much, but I know it's important for others.",0.6887,70,17.5,0.0,1.80661
"I've been using this paddle for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed. There are several aspects of this paddle that I particularly enjoy: the grit on the face, the handle, and the weight.<br /><br />Firstly, the ""Max Grit"" on the face makes a difference, even for an amateur player like myself. The grit gives more control over your shots, and over the past weeks I've noticed a difference in my shots.<br /><br />Secondly, I really like the handle--both the length and the circumference. This paddle is a joy to hold. My other main paddle has a much shorter handle, so the longer handle on this paddle is a welcome change (shorter vs. longer handles is a separate discussion). Additionally, the circumference of the handle makes the paddle feel very natural to hold. This was something I never really paid attention to before this paddle. The stock grip on the paddle is fine; it feels high quality and I have not noticed any issues with sweat absorption.<br /><br />Lastly, the weight is just right. This paddle weighs in at ~7.7 oz, so firmly in the ""medium weight"" category. My main concern with paddle weight is that a too-heavy paddle can bring shoulder or arm injuries after long/frequent playing sessions. Fortunately, this paddle is comfortable even for longer sessions (3+ hours).<br /><br />As a bonus comment, the white and gold color looks great in person. Definitely the best colorway in my opinion. The paddle will obviously get some scuffs along the way (which is a bummer), but it is a beautiful paddle nonetheless.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this paddle.",0.986,352,27.07692307692308,0.0,2.2958
"I recently found out about electric handwarmers, so naturally, I needed to try one myself. And this one has not disappointed!<br /><br />The warmer has a nice heavy feel (but not too heavy), warms quickly, and can double as a phone/device charger. It has a relatively large 10,000 mAh battery, which can input and output 5v/2a (i.e., twice the amount of the small Apple chargers that used to come with iPhones).<br /><br />According to the specs, the battery should last 6 hours on max settings, which feels about right, given my regular usage (I didn't do a dedicated battery life test). The warmer has 4 different heat settings, though I only use the highest one, which is warm enough for me. You can also check the battery level by double pressing the (only) button.<br /><br />The special feature of this warmer is that the battery can be swapped out. However, the battery required is Ocoopa's proprietary battery, which makes the battery swapping slightly less appealing. It would have been nice if you could use any USB battery.<br /><br />The warmer comes with a lanyard and a USB-C cable to charge with. Overall, I'm pleased with it and would get it again.",0.9568,264,33.0,0.0,1.88704
"I'll start by saying that I'm a pickleball newbie. This wrap is a big step up from the stock wrap on my paddle. While it is a bit more expensive than other paddle wraps, you realize see why. Unlike other wraps (which are flat and tape-like), this feels much more premium.<br /><br />The wrap is very comfortable to hold, does a great job wicking sweat, and it quite tacky. I didn't have any trouble putting it on my paddle, and after playing with it for a few days, I'm a big fan. The ridges on the wrap supposedly allow for more airflow (and less sweat as a result), I haven't noticed a difference on that front.<br /><br />Overall, I definitely recommend this wrap.",0.9593,160,26.666666666666668,0.0,2.28779
"Love this paddle! This is my first paddle, as I am a pickleball newbie. For context, I've been playing ~8 hours per week for the past couple months. After using the wooden paddles for a few weeks, I decided to get my own.<br /><br />This paddle is absolutely my favorite of any of the paddles I've tried, (and I tried paddles of all shapes, sizes, weights, etc). The elongated shape is helpful when reaching for balls and slamming, although the sweet spot is a little smaller than on a wide-body or standard paddle. The slightly smaller sweet spot has not affected my play.<br /><br />The face of this PCKL paddle is a textured graphite and it makes a very satisfying sound/feel when you hit the ball just right. The paddle is also on the lighter side (weighing ~7.5 oz), which allows me to hit to ball a little harder without it going way out of bounds.<br /><br />Lastly, I really like the look and design of the paddle. The white/green look is very clean, and the green outline around the face helps you easily spot it when in a stack of paddles (at a pickup court).<br /><br />I have 2 gripes, both very minor. One is that the length of the handle is a *tiny* bit short for my liking--another few centimeters would have been perfect (that said, I am used to how the length now). Secondly, the stock grip doesn't absorb sweat very well, so I'd recommend adding some grip tape (the paddle comes with some!).<br /><br />While the common wisdom is that elongated paddles are for experienced players only, I am thrilled with this as my first paddle, and I would absolutely get it again.",0.9931,370,33.63636363636363,0.0,2.29793
"Good wrap tape. Comes with 6 wraps in the package. Both ends are tapered.<br /><br />I used these to wrap a pickleball paddle, and it definitely does the trick. It’s nice and tacky, and much more sweat absorbent than my previous wrap. I think these *could* be grippier, but overall, pretty grippy. A noticeable positive difference from the stock wrap I had before. Would recommend.",0.952,87,12.428571428571429,0.0,1.8856000000000002
"This is a great racket bag. Not too big or bulky, but with plenty of storage for whatever you might need to play. Additionally, it can hold multiple rackets of varying sizes (it holds my squash racket and my pickleball paddle without any issues). I also appreciate that it has a separate compartment for your court shoes (shoe bag included!).<br /><br />Other than the racket and shoe compartments, it has a large compartment that you can fit towels/shower stuff/etc in. There are also two smaller zippered compartments on the front of the bag, where I keep my balls, wrap tape, wallet, phone, etc. Additionally, there is a netted compartment on the side of the bag where you can put a water bottle. There is also a plastic hook by the shoulder straps so you can hang the bag in a locker or on a fence.<br /><br />Lastly, I like the aesthetic of the bag. I'm usually not a huge fan of camouflage patterns, but the pattern on this bag is understated. I'd definitely recommend this bag for anyone looking for a small/medium sized racket bag!",0.9595,227,22.7,0.0,2.28785

"In the box is a lantern with three AA batteries installed, a headlamp with two CR2032 batteries installed, and an instruction sheet. Note that the instruction sheet says that the AA batteries are not included but in mine they were included. I had to unscrew the compartment to remove tape holding the end batteries from connecting. A super tiny Philipps screwdriver is needed to get into either battery compartment.<br /><br />The lantern works. It has a nice handle and the on/off button cycles through just turning the eyes on or turning the bottom on as well as turning the unit off. Both top and bottom cannot be on at the same time. I would have liked this option, so that is a negative. However, the unit is cute.<br /><br />I had to throw out the headlamp. It would not turn on. I bought new batteries and it still didn't work. Then I tested the batteries that came with the unit in a bike light I have and the batteries worked. The headlamp is junk and that is disappointing. I tried for about 10 minutes to get this to work but could not.<br /><br />The current price of $16.99 ($19.99 minus $3) is competitively priced for this especially if it comes with both sets of batteries. I am unsure if that is the case for others or if the batteries were included by mistake for the lantern or not. Also, I do not know what the ""flash eyes"" comment means on the Amazon site. The eyes DO NOT flash, if that is what it means. Since I had to throw out the headlamp, I do not have confidence in this set. Also, I wish the lantern had the ability to fully light up. Therefore, this gets 2.5 stars from me, rounded up to 3 stars.",0.7962,363,19.105263157894736,0.1,1.4688600000000003
"This comes in a very long heavy box. In the box are:<br /><br />- 16 long tubes<br />- 16 short tubes<br />- 32 right angles<br />- 8 nets<br />- 16 two-way clips<br />- 4 flathead grooved base<br />- 4 Phillips head grooved base<br /><br />Installation is easy in the sense that all I had to do was insert the long poles on the top and bottom of each net and the short poles on the side into the channels. However, strength is required to seat the final set of right angles on each panel. The Velcroed end gets inserted last. Finally, the Velcro strap goes around the post and net (see photo) to keep that channel secure.<br /><br />Although the installation was easy, it took me about three hours because it was very tedious and repetitive and there were so many parts. In the end I wound up with eight panels. The clips are used to clip the panels together and they turn on the tube so that the fences can be configured into a quad configuration, a square, or just a haphazard fence as I did in my photos.  The rubber bases just hold the fence upright as long as it is not too windy. In the wind, the fence bends with the direction of the blow.<br /><br />The fence can be folded for storage at the joints. The only thing is the bases are heavy and need to be carried separately. For the current price of $299.99, it would have been great if they included a bag to carry the bases in. Nevertheless, this fence is excellent and delivers as described.",0.9463,349,29.08333333333333,0.1,2.31389
"I have another one of [[ASIN:B091GF5B46 these]] type foot baths and fell in love with it so much that I wanted another one.<br /><br />In the package is one carry pouch and one very small outdoor foot bath. The basin is fully collapsible and very small.  I unfolded it completely and made sure the edge of the basin was standing up.<br /><br />As can be seen by my photos, I actually used this indoors and it worked. I had to be careful not to let water flow over the edge. This is really for outdoor use only. To ensure the water stays inside, I only filled it several inches, enough to soak up to the base of my ankles.<br /><br />Once I was done, I rinsed the bath out. There was a water spot on my floor because the bottom of the basin gets wet when in the sink--another reason this should be used outdoors. Note that it takes many hours for this basin to dry. <br /><br />I was actually going to rate this 4 stars like I did my other one because it operates exactly the same.  However, the purple color of this bath bled all over my towels and I could not rinse the color out. It destroyed my towels.<br /><br />In summary, this foot bath is portable and does work as long as one is careful. However, this can be repurposed as an ice bucket with drinks for a picnic or to hold small beach toys for the kids. At the current price of $7.99, this is more expensive than the one I already own. It is not great but does somewhat serve the purpose it was intended for. What I love about this is that I do not have to carry a heavy pail to bathe my feet. Also, it folds down nicely. This would have received 4 stars from me if it were not for the color bleed. I cannot recommend this due to that issue and my recommendation would be to purchase this [[ASIN:B091GF5B46 one]] instead. Not only is that one cheaper but there is no color bleed.<br /><br />UPDATE: I washed the towels twice that this bucket bled on and the color DID NOT come out. This is such a BIG NEGATIVE. Even if using this outdoors, the color will bleed all over--one's clothes, the camper floor, the towels, etc.",0.3227,493,23.476190476190474,0.1,0.92681

Per the Amazon site, this yoga wheel is rated for a load of up to 550 pounds.<br /><br />The massager is great for my plantar fasciitis as I just roll it under my feet.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent and well made yoga wheel. The current price of $48.59 does seem a bit steep but the quality is outstanding and there are others with nubs like this that sell for more.",0.9762,179,29.83333333333333,0.1,2.32286
"[[VIDEOID:ced4536390eb152e3ed68d764b42c1b0]] I have no idea what is meant by breakaway in the name of this bag; nevertheless, this is well-made and sturdy and not just for yoga. It can be used as a large carry purse or work satchel, an overnight bag, or for carrying a yoga mat or exercise roll (see my photo).<br /><br />There is a shoulder strap, although that is not well padded. I would have preferred more padding in the strap. There are also carry handles that are large enough to actually put around my shoulder to carry the bag.<br /><br />The front has two pockets--one folder pocket and one zippered pocket. The back has one folder pocket. The central compartment is separated into two full sides with a center divider for a water bottle and other incidentals. There is also a small zippered pocket in the center with a keychain for the keys. I did find that sometimes that zipper got stuck on that keyring material as they sewed it a bit too close to the zipper.<br /><br />The elasticized straps for holding a yoga mat or exercise roll need to be fed through the holes in the bag. When they are not in use, the clips on the one side can also be used for keys.<br /><br />Overall, this is a well-thought out bag. It is larger than I expected but can be used as a weekend bag, a purse, a work satchel, or a gym/yoga tote. I would have preferred more padding on the shoulder strap and do wish the keyring material was not so easily caught on the small zippered compartment in the center. However, this does not take away from the utility of this tote.  The current price of $59.99 is competitively priced for a bag of this quality and design. Note that this is made in Cambodia with both the interior and exterior made of 100% Polyester with PU Coating.",-0.7232,386,27.571428571428573,0.2,1.84304
"These are perfect as hand exercisers after carpal tunnel surgery or just to strengthen the hands in general. The balls have a slight difference in resistance levels but there is no mention of what resistance ""in pounds"" they are. From the Amazon site I know:<br /><br />- yellow is extra-soft<br /><br />- red is soft<br /><br />- green is  medium<br /><br />- blue - firm<br /><br />They still feel great to squeeze. They are not too hard and not too soft; they are perfect in my opinion. It does come with an exercise sheet which is great. The eight exercises mentioned are power grip, pinch, thumb extension, table roll, finger flexion, thumb roll, finger squeeze, and thumb opposition.<br /><br />In addition to strength training, these are good to occupy an autistic child. I actually ordered this for my friend who has a severely autistic child and loves items like these. He is constantly squeezing things, biting things, and working with his hands.<br /><br />The current price of $11.99 is competitively priced.",0.9911,243,30.375,0.2,1.9573300000000002

"This beach ""towel"" comes rolled up in a carry case that is a little larger than a water bottle holder. This is made in China of 90% polyester and10% polyamide. It should not be washed in water above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) and should never be put in the dryer, ironed, dry cleaned, or bleached.<br /><br />The material does not feel like the microfiber dusty clothes I have come to know which is fuzzy and catches a lot of lint. Instead, this towel is super soft and slinky and thin. It is also large as can be seen when I laid it across the foot of my king-sized bed. The material repels sand, which is great. However, this is not super absorbent in my opinion. I do not like drying myself with this at all. It does absorb water some but it does not feel right against the skin as a beach towel. I felt like I was drying myself with a slinky scarf.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I love the design and functionality of this towel. Unfortunately, once the towel is removed from its carrier, the carrier becomes useless. I tried to put the towel back into its carrier after it was dry and it was impossible. Eventually, the carrier just ripped (see photo).<br /><br />In summary, I consider this more of a thin beach cloth or mat than a towel. I love that it repels sand, feels great against the skin, is lightweight, and large. I love the idea of a carry case but the case is way too small that it becomes useless. I do love the elastic on the towel which allows me to keep it tightly rolled. However, I would never use this like a beach towel to dry myself off. It can, however, be used a little like a wrap on the lower half of the body or slightly over the shoulders. The current price of $20.89 ($21.99 minus 5%) is a little pricey for this.

It also registered equivalent numbers, so I know this is working.<br /><br />Reading the insert that comes with this can be intimidating. I was never able to understand it all. However, operation of this pulse oximeter is simple as I described above. The most difficult part of this was attaching the lanyard to the device.

"I ordered this pack in their [[ASIN:B07RHNRB6R smaller 20L size]] and decided to order this larger one as well.<br /><br />This backpack is a bit unexpected in its design. It folds into the exterior pocket. Therefore, the pouch that it came in is actually the outside pocket of the pack. All I had to do was unzip the pouch and unfold the backpack from within that pouch. The act of unfurling the bag forms the lower exterior zippered pocket. All that was left was to do was to tuck the loop inside and zipper the pocket.<br /><br />I was able to fit some heavy books inside with room to spare. However, I do not recommend using this for books or a computer. Since there is no padding in the straps, it is uncomfortable to walk long distances with this unless the items inside are lightweight--like soft clothing.<br /><br />The material reminds me of the baggalini-type bags made of a strong nylon. However, this backpack is thin, so I do feel anything with sharp edges would tear through this after prolonged use.  The material is water resistant. I put part of the pack under running water and the water just rolled right off.<br /><br />Besides two exterior pockets and one interior folder pocket, there are two mesh water bottle pockets on each side that fit my standard-sized water bottles with room to spare. The shoulder straps have a tiny pocket on each side for a flip phone or perhaps tissues, etc. There is a chest strap and side cinch straps, since this is a larger (meaning taller) bag. The tiny reflective strips at the edges of the outside pocket, in the center of the bag, and on the outside mesh of the water bottle pockets are a nice safety touch. In this larger size, they sewed the reflector strap to the outside of the water bottle pockets which allows it to be shown. They did not do that correctly with the smaller version.<br /><br />Overall, for the current price of $21.99 plus 5% off with a coupon savings, I feel this is competitively priced. It packs small and light and is perfect to carry around for when an extra backpack is needed. However, this 35L size is taller than a full-sized backpack and comes without any cushioning. The water bottle pockets are a little wide, so larger bottles will fit in those pockets.  I would not put a laptop in this unless it is protected with a padded sleever or otterbox type case. I would also not carry anything heavy in here since there is no shoulder padding; I certainly found it to be uncomfortable to use with heavy items inside.

I was able to fit a couple of pounds of mandarins inside along with my wallet and a few other incidentals. I walked around with this a little bit and found it to be comfortable as long as I cinched the shoulder straps tighter.

"I am a bit disappointed in this tumbler because I expected it to keep my tea hot for 8 hours. The Amazon site says it keeps drinks cold for 24+ hours or hot for 8 hours"" but it only kept my tea hot for about 3 hours and that is with the top FULLY CLOSED. After 8 hours it was almost as cold as if it had been in the refrigerator. Below are my likes and dislikes about this thermos.<br /><br />LIKES<br />- The silicone bottom keeps this from sliding and enables it to stand securely in place.<br /><br />- The silicone center makes it easy to hold for drinking because my hands do not slip off the sides.<br /><br />- The top has both an open and close indicator on the rim and a directional arrow to show which way the top should be turned. Turning it further beyond the close will remove the top.<br /><br />- I love the deep blue color.<br /><br />- It does come with a limited lifetime warranty but I doubt it is financially sensible to use since one has to mail it back.<br /><br />DISLIKES<br />- The contents do not stay hot for longer than 3 hours.<br /><br />- I am unsure if the plastic holes in the two arms on the top and the arms itself will bend and wear out over time. If those arms break that keep the top in its track, then this tumbler will become useless as a tumbler. It will then become a cup. I think these plastic arms are its breaking point.<br /><br />In summary, this is a decent tumbler if one will be drinking their hot contents within about 3 hours. Any longer than 3 hours causes the contents to cool and become lukewarm to cold EVEN if the top is fully sealed--which mine was. I do feel the top design is interesting but the plastic arms of the locking mechanism are its breaking point. I am personally disappointed in this. I ordered this for hot beverages and not cold and this does not serve my purpose fully. I suspect this will be better as a cold liquid tumbler but is not great for keeping contents hot for the time specified.",0.907,458,35.23076923076923,0.1,1.5021000000000002

"[[VIDEOID:92883454e041f127c0f7a42a11a0470a]] This game is highly entertaining and lots of fun to play. Although it is called Whirl Ball, it is exactly like the Skeet Ball played in the Arcades down the shore but on a mobile and smaller scale. Despite its entertainment value, there are some flaws with this game. Nevertheless, I rated this 3 stars ONLY BECAUSE of how much fun this is. However, if you want an accurate and quality game, look elsewhere.<br /><br />FLAWS<br /><br />- First,  assembly is not ""tool-free"" as the box claims. It is difficult to assemble and a screwdriver is required to install the three AAA batteries (NOT INCLUDED) for the scoring mechanism. It comes in five pieces excluding the arrow stickers that have to be placed on the ramp.  There is a ball return shoot that connects to the ramp (2 pieces), left and right ends for the score zone area (2 pieces), and the electronic scoring mechanism (1 piece). I had incredible difficulty trying to seat the left and right end for the score zone area. The instructions are not very good and there are arms (see second photo) that have to be turned to the side so that they are flush with the end. If that is not done, they are in the way. Also, it feels as if the plastic is going to break when assembling this. It took me about 25 minutes to assemble these five pieces mostly because of those left and right ends.<br /><br />- Second, the instructions are practically useless and there really is not any good information on how to play the game itself.<br /><br />- Third, the plastic feels extremely cheap. At the current price of $49.99, I expected much better.<br /><br />- Fourth, I ripped a sticker when removing it from the page it came on. They really should already have the stickers affixed to the ramp before shipment so that they are straight and there is no chance of it being torn during assembly. The stickers for the scoring area are already in place so there is no reason these cannot be affixed at the factory.<br /><br />- Fifth, the electronic scoring unit misses scores. When the play is started, a cheer similar to what happens at a ballgame is played. If my boyfriend or I immediately rolled the ball and made a score, the score would not be counted. Instead we had to wait until the cheer was almost done before playing, so .5 seconds is lost on the clock for the 30-second play. Also, it does not count the score if two balls make a score one right after the other.  You will notice :30 into my video that it counted one 20 pointer and then missed the second one after that. Therefore, when the score said 70, it should have gone up to 90. This means, one has to slow down their play to ensure that all scores are counted. What I noticed is that when it plays back the score count, it will not count the next ball that is sunk during that verbal playback.<br /><br />- Sixth, the ramp is not really smooth as there is a bump at the connection that causes the ball to ""trip up"" sometimes.<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- Automatic Ball Return Shoot<br />- Built-In Electronic Scoring<br />- Folding Legs<br />- Multiple Score Zones<br />- 2 Whirl Balls<br />- Authentic Arcade Feel<br /><br />In summary, my boyfriend and I love the game. It is lots of fun and provides a truly 5-star experience. However, quality and accuracy are lacking for such a high price point of $49.99.",0.9709,764,29.384615384615383,2.0,2.09127

In addition, I expect these will last long because they feel like good quality socks.<br /><br />They wash well in the washer but I hang dry them.",0.9902,162,20.25,0.1,1.9270600000000002
"[[VIDEOID:4efefdd0a4252dd270b43bf5abf224e1]] I have three hydration packs (see list below). Of the two I tested so far, I love this one the best. Note that this pack also does not come with instructions and I found that none of them do.<br /><br />1 - This one - [[ASIN:B07MR4GJL8 Thule (pronounced Toolie) Uptake Hydration Pack, 8L with 2.5L Hydrapak--about 85 fluid ounces]] - superb pack; 5 stars<br />2 -  [[ASIN:B07GHR1RSQ Osprey Women's Salida 8 (about 85 ounces)]] - excellent pack; 4 stars<br />3 - [[ASIN:B07HJVD4GX CamelBak M.U.L.E. LR 15 100oz]] - I have not tested this one yet<br /><br />After using this Thule, I absolutely love it even more than my Osprey. It is extremely well designed, comfortable, and stylish and has a cavernous interior for storage.<br /><br />PROS<br />- There are several loops all over the pack including one on the bottom that can be used to affix a bike light, hang a helmet with a carbiner, etc.<br /><br />- There's an outer zippered pocket to store small items such as a cell phone, Chapstick, tissues, etc.<br /><br />- The main pocket has one mesh zippered pocket next to the hydration bladder that can be used for a cell phone or similarly sized items. There is a large storage area in front of that for a wallet, shirt, or other personal effects for the day.<br /><br />- Behind the inner zippered pocket is the compartment for the hydration bladder.<br /><br />- The hydration bladder is 2.5L or about 85 ounces. The pack has a tiny cloth loop that holds the bladder upright when full so that it does not sink to the bottom of the pack. All I had to do was unhook the bladder, slide off the clip, pull it apart like a Zip-lock bag, then fold over with the tracks facing outward, and slip on the clip to close. Note that it is possible to fold the bladder the wrong way. Make sure the fold has the tracks facing out on both sides. Once the bladder is closed, re-attach it to the cloth loop.<br /><br />- The pack has adjustable waist and chest belts.<br /><br />- The tubing to the reservoir has a magnetic track that keeps it in place along the chest area of the pack. This is absolutely wonderful even though the track and bite valve faces down and not up toward the mouth. Therefore, when biking, one has to grab the tubing to drink. There is also another loop and clip through which the tubing passes.<br /><br />- The bite valve is removable for drying. It also has a locking mechanism to lock it so that water does not seep out.<br /><br />- The pack has padding in the shoulder and lumbar region for extra comfort.<br /><br />CONS<br />- This comes with zero instructions but since this is not my first pack, I had no trouble operating this pack.<br /><br />- My major complaint is that the water coming out of the bladder tastes awful. It tastes like a new shower curtain smells. I was told that I could partially fill the bladder with water and squeeze lemon juice into it and then freeze it to get rid of the taste. I have not tried that yet. This is typical of ALL hydration bladders I tried, unfortunately.<br /><br />Overall, I love the way this pack is engineered and how comfortable it is to use. Its simplicity is its biggest virtue along with the magnetic tubing track to keep the tubing in place. I used this once so far on a two-hour walk and I did not even know I was wearing this. The bite value is easily accessible but does face down. This means a biker would have to grab it and bring it toward the mouth to use.  Drying the bladder between use requires that I stuff the bladder mouth with a silicone ramekin and hang it upside down for several days. It takes about three to four days to dry since this hydration bladder has two halves on the interior.<br /><br />Video - My recorder is awful; I apologize for the blurriness. Please note that the hydration bladder is 2.5L and the 8L refers to the cargo space and not the reservoir.<br /><br />Photo 1 is of the specifications.<br /><br />Photos 2-5 is of the pack.<br /><br />Photo 6 shows the bladder.<br /><br />Photo 7 shows the bladder opening. Note that I inserted a Kiwi cutter into the mouth of the bladder to show where the opening is so I could take a picture. However, that green item DOES NOT come with this pack.",0.9888,1005,35.892857142857146,0.0,2.29664
"[[VIDEOID:f899b5904dd638d027a40416fde9e9f1]] This is my first hydration pack and it does not come with any instructions. It took me about one hour to figure everything out--particularly the hydration bladder. However, after using this, I love it. It is extremely well designed, comfortable, and stylish. I also love the color.<br /><br />PROS<br />- There's a loop for a light on the bottom of the pack.<br /><br />- It has a bike helmet clip.<br /><br />- There's an outer pocket to store clothing.<br /><br />- The inner pocket has one covered zippered pocket for cell phone, Chapstick, etc. There's also a mesh zippered pocket below that and another folder-like pocket opposite that in addition to the main compartment area for minimal storage.<br /><br />- Behind the inner pocket is the zippered compartment for the hydration bladder.<br /><br />- The hydration bladder is 2.5L or 85 ounces. It comes with a handle and the pack has a tiny cinch strap that holds the bladder upright when full so that it does not sink to the bottom of the pack. I did a search on YouTube for ""How to fill Osprey Hydration pack,"" and found Chris SERF's very helpful video. Prior to viewing that video I just could not figure out how to open the main bladder compartment after I got the slide cinch off the bladder.<br /><br />- The pack has a waist belt and a chest belt with magnetic closure.<br /><br />- The tubing to the reservoir has a magnetic disk that clips it onto the chest belt area of the pack. There are also various loops through which the tubing can pass.<br /><br />- The bite valve is removable. Another YouTuber said there is a locking mechanism to lock the bite valve but I could not get it to lock. Sometimes water will leak out of the bite valve but I only had that happen once.<br /><br />- It has a mesh back to increase air flow which reduces but does not eliminate sweating against the pack.<br /><br />CONS<br />- This comes with zero instructions and I could not find a video on the Osprey website on how to fill the hydration bladder. As of this writing, there are also no manuals for the Salida under the customer support section.<br /><br />- The tubing is about two inches too short for my build. Since the card that came with the pack says the tubing can be cut, I think the tubing should be lengthened as it can always be made shorter but it is impossible to make longer.<br /><br />- My major complaint is that the water coming out of the bladder tastes awful. It tastes like a new shower curtain smells. I was only able to drink about half a cup as I kept spitting it out. I wrote and tweeted Osprey and they have not yet responded with a solution. However, the YouTuber, Chris MORSF, whose video helped me learn how to open the bladder said that the ""Only thing that I can think of is Steriliser tablets like what is used for babies bottles then giving the bladder a very thorough rinse out with water."" I have yet to try that.<br /><br />Overall,  I love the way this pack is engineered and how comfortable it is. I used this once so far on a two-hour walk and I did not even know I was wearing this. I had a concern of drying the bladder between use but came up with my own solution of stuffing the bladder mouth with a silicone ramekin (see last photo) and hanging it upside down for several days. It dried in two days and the tubing is almost dry as of day three. If Osprey addressed all three CONS and provided instructions or a link to instructions for a neophyte user like me and how to get rid of that bad taste, I would have rated this five stars.  I attached a video that I hope is helpful and some pictures of this Osprey Salida 8 Women's pack.<br /><br />UPDATE May 14, 2019 - I finally heard from Osprey regarding the two questions I had. I have yet to try either solution.<br /><br />1 – To get rid of the disgusting plastic flavor of the water, they recommend freezing the reservoir with lemon juice to clean it out. They also have cleaning tablets available that help with the taste.<br /><br />2- With regard to the bite valve lock being unmovable, they recommend running it under hot water and then twisting it.",0.9907,946,36.38461538461539,0.7,2.1072100000000002
"Although this is thin and lightweight, it is a super functional sun hat.<br /><br />What I like<br />- It has an UPF (ultraviolet protection factor) of 50+ for UVA rays.<br />- It has a neck cover. That cover can be folded under the rim if it is not wanted.<br />- The chin strap has a cinching button and the entire strap is removable since it is only clipped into the hat.<br />- The sizing is adjustable via the tie in the back outside of the hat.<br />- It has a wide front brim to shield my eyes from glaring sun.<br />- The hole in the back is to push a ponytail through as seen in the pictures on the Amazon site. Note that the third picture I attached shows a piece of plastic I pulled through the hole for demo purposes. I would have preferred no ponytail hole only because I do not have one any longer.<br />- This hat is attractive to wear (at least on me).<br /><br />What I dislike a little in order of importance to me<br />- The ponytail slot leaves some exposed hair (or skin, if one is bald).<br />- It has to be hand washed.<br />- This is made in China as is everything these days.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very functional and extremely useful sun hat. I will be using this on my daily walks.",0.9061,310,62.0,0.3,2.36183
"I ordered this for my cat Jake because putting on PJs or a shirt before bed is the only thing that keeps him quiet throughout the night. I always purchase a size small for him because an XS is usually too small. However, these are huge as can be seen from the last three photos. He is about 10 pounds and has a 12-13"" back. Therefore, an XXS or P would have probably fit him but not this small which is rated for a whippet or dog with an 18"" back.<br /><br />I only took off one point for the sizing because had I seen the size chart I would have known it would not have fit. However, the size chart on the Amazon site differs a bit from the sizing listed on the packaging. For example, according to the size chart on the packaging, a whippet can take between a S and M but on the Amazon site it says a small.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a wonderful set of PJ's for indoor or outdoor wear.  They feel high quality, are warm, and made of soft fleece. It has a detachable hood that is affixed in place via snaps.  There is a hole at the center of the neckline (under the collar) for a leash to pass through.  There are jersey cuffs around all four paws to keep the leggings in place. Overall, this is a wonderful ""coat"" that is machine washable (but hang dry) and is reasonably priced at the current price of $19.21. Just be very careful of the sizing. The first photo shows the size chart on the packaging but there is also reasonable sizing recommendations on the Amazon site even if they do not match exactly with the packaging photo.",0.9622,342,24.428571428571427,0.0,1.8886600000000002
"I was on the fence about ordering this for two reasons. First, it is expensive and even though I get this at a discount being a reviewer, I had to ask myself if I would ever pay so much. Second, I am not the baseball cap type of person; I am more into the newsboy style.<br /><br />However, I love this cap. The minty green blue color is refreshing for summer. Also, the cap is super soft and I feel so comfortable wearing this.  It is collapsible in the sense that it does not stand up on its own. I actually had to put a bowl underneath it to take the picture.<br /><br />The fastener in back is Velcro and easy to re-adjust. It is rated as 50 UPF sun protection and claims to be cooling. So far it feels very cooling on me.<br /><br />I am so in love with this hat that I wore it around the house when I first got it.  After having tried this, I would indeed pay the current price of $28.76 to buy this.",0.9634,220,22.0,0.1,2.3190199999999996
"I  have been weightlifting for almost 34 years with a couple of years off due to changes in life circumstances. Eight months ago I started lifting again three times per week and was so overjoyed to see find these collars that I ordered them without fully reading the measurements.<br /><br />My bar is almost one inch and these are for two-inch bars. I am so thoroughly disappointed. Please do not make the same mistake I did. Nevertheless, I had a microphone that was just the right size and I affixed it to that and can tell that these are fantastic. It created a solid grip and did not budge when I pulled on it. Part of the internal collar has what feels like (but is not) a rubberized grip that keeps it in place.<br /><br />To me these are a great invention. My current collars keep loosening as I bench press and plate clamps such as these would ensure that the weights stay on the bar without rattling around and that a quick change of weights is possible. All that has to be done is to loosen the clip, slip the collar onto the bar, and then snap it in place flush with the weight.<br /><br />These plate clamps remind me of another great but simple invention that I consider fantastic in the weightlifting world and that is the [[ASIN:B0017DGBY8 Manta Ray]]. It is a product I love and have used previously for about 20 years until I stopped doing squats.<br /><br />The first picture is of the collars. Note that the clamp on the left is open for demo purposes in the picture. The second picture shows it on my weightlifting bar. The third photo shows that it is not meant for that bar because my bar is just a tad under one inch and this is for a two-inch bar. The last photo shows how it grips a microphone with the correct circumference for these collars. I tried that because I had nothing else to test this on.",0.9857,394,26.266666666666666,0.0,2.29571
"I ordered their [[ASIN:B07M8K5VQ8 Titanium spork]] and decided to order this pair as well since it was cheaper and I needed an extra one for my boyfriend when I do day trips.<br /><br />This is a thick plastic spork that is just somewhat stronger than a typical plastic utensil. It is BPA-free and is food and dishwasher safe. There is a fork on one end with one of the tines that has a ""knife-like"" edge. There is a spoon on the other end. The center holes can be used to fasten this to a backpack using the reusable teather it comes packaged with.<br /><br />I got this because many times when I go on a staycation, I pack a cooler with yogurt and stuff for day travel. This is perfect for that. I ate with the spoon and fork fine but I could not cut anything of substance with the knife. I think $4.99 is reasonable for what this is but the knife-like edge is completely useless. A butter knife cuts better. However, the spoon and fork are good for any ""away-type"" eating such as camping, backpacking, or just a staycation with a cooler in tow.<br /><br />Even though the price is right, the reason I give this 3 stars is because the knife is useless and the thick plastic has a different mouth feel and pick-up ability. For instance, when I was eating yogurt with the spoon, I could not scrape the container as easily with the spoon end as I could with the [[ASIN:B07M8K5VQ8 Titanium Spork]]. This is good enough but neither their Titanium spork or this one is great.<br /><br />I attached two pictures.

However, since it is dark, it does pick up all my cats' hair and lint.  What I do not like about this sweatshirt is that it is about half the thickness I would expect for a jacket listed at $65 retail.  It is very thin and I really dislike that. I have not washed this yet, but based on the feel of the fleece inside, I would hang dry this or dry it on low.

"I really love this light. I ordered this to attach to my backpack when walking. It charges via a USB port in 50 minutes. Since the wheel has to be moved to expose the USB port, it can get in the way of a charging port.

I use the USB on my computer or my wall charger, instead, when needed.<br /><br />There are four modes.

So far I love how this makes it easy to incorporate something new into my routine. The one thing I dislike is that the handles keep slipping along cloth grip.

However, I did not fully understand them. Instead I located a great video online on how to play Bocce which I put in the comments section of my review.<br /><br />The object of the game is to get points by throwing the balls as close to the pallina as possible. We both watched the video I found, which provided the best instruction. My boyfriend and I played about seven or eight games. We even hit the ball along the wooden track and the balls did not break (at least not yet), so that is a plus.<br /><br />The Bocce balls and pallina are really nice. However, there are several DISLIKES I have about this set and the reason I took off one star.<br /><br />DISLIKES in order of importance to me:<br />- The bag is super cheap and thin. The logo on the bag is crooked; the handles are not centered from left to right so carrying it was tilted; and it is so thin that I have to store the balls in the box inside the bag. I wanted to throw the box out but I would advise against it since it seems the balls will rip through the bag. If the box falls through, at least I have something else to carry the balls in.<br /><br />- This comes with no instructions. The instructions should be included in the set to be considered complete. Instead there are two pages of thank you notes that are useless to me.<br /><br />- The measuring tool is just a shoelace with two thin plastic pointers. There's nothing wrong with that; but it is also cheap.<br /><br />If they fixed all these dislikes, I would have rated this five stars.

The one I ordered is 12 inches tall and is sufficient for rolling along one thigh or calf at a time or my back.<br /><br />This is very light. It feels like a solid Styrofoam cup in the shape of a roller. I think the price of $12.99 is a bit expensive for this. Nevertheless it works somewhat well to stretch out my muscles and is somewhat soothing. On the other hand, I totally dislike the sticker that is affixed to the roller because it takes some effort to remove and peels off a few foam particles with it.

"This is a very tiny table that stands 15 inches tall when fully opened (17 inches when closed) and stands a few inches below my knee. The table/stool has a small 10 inch by 12 inch surface area. It is designed for use when sitting in a low camp chair. This is also  very light and easy to carry when folded because the frame acts as a handle. What I particularly love about this tiny side table is that it opens and closes easily but is structurally sound when in either position. I own a full-sized plastic table that is designed to open and close the same way but dangerously collapses at the slightest touch. This table does not do that because it sort of locks in place. It also appears to be made of aluminum.<br /><br />I purchased this to use as a small table for my balcony for plants and for use as a temporary table to lay books or other items next to me when I am sitting at my desk. I love that it folds down thin enough that I can store it behind or under furniture. I bought mine for $14.99 at a Sierra Trading Post store near me. This was their regular price and they only had one left which was a floor sample. It also had a slight scratch in the top but the table so impressed me that I overlooked that and purchased it anyway since it is also cheaper than Amazon. According to Amazon's site it can also be used as a stool for anyone weighing 200 pounds or less. I tried it as a stool and it was reasonably comfortable.<br /><br />In summary, this table may be tiny standing 15 inches tall when open but it is well-designed and versatile for many uses as a side table or stool. It folds down thin and the frame can be used as a carrying handle. It is also light enough to carry anywhere. It is easy enough to set up and close yet sturdy enough not to collapse in on itself at the slightest touch. I consider this perfect for home, camping, or just using anywhere one needs a tiny chair (for those under 200 pounds) or tiny side table (for plants, at a ballfield, etc.).

"There is a minute and a half video online at the GaiamRestore site that explains how to select a roller; however, I did not yet see any &#34;How To Videos&#34; for this roller as the packaging claims.  Nevertheless, from the picture on the packaging, I just grasp it behind my back with both hands and roll. I can do the same rolling pin style on my thighs. Overall, this roller does what it is supposed to but it fails on one point. I feel that it is about 6 inches too short. I would have given this five stars if the roller were longer so that I do not feel like a contortionist using it.",-0.748,134,22.33333333333333,0.1,1.4056000000000002
"I did not realize that this would not fit my car. I have a 2006 Toyota Camry Solara Convertible and the box says it will not fit years 1993 to 2008. Nevertheless, I decided to see for myself. Due to the way the bike rack is configured, the top bar almost comes off the trunk.  As a result, there would be room for only one bike as the track adjusts back and forth depending on how tight it has to be cinched (based on the car model, of course). There are two provided clips that go through the holes to keep the track from sliding after the correct length is reached.<br /><br />I then wanted to try this on my boyfriend's car which is a 2010 Honda Accord and it also will not fit that either without a special part. Overall, I am disappointed. I had automatically assumed bike racks were universal and did not realize that was not the case. I also did not realize that there is a chart that can be consulted to check for fit. That was my mistake.<br /><br />Despite this, based on what I have noticed with this rack, the instructions are not very good. Both my boyfriend and I tried to figure them out and found them confusing. In addition, neither one of us believe this would fit three bikes unless the top rod was fastened all the way out and I doubt one would have that option on every car. Had this worked on my car, I would have given this three stars based on my other observations.",-0.8446,305,23.46153846153846,0.0,0.5466200000000001
"I'm 5'5&#34; and this bag stands above my waist. When I have it on as a backpack it extends from the back of my lower thighs to the top of my head.<br /><br />I have 30&#34; snowshoes and decided to purchase this large bag that fits 36&#34; snowshoes because I could not find a medium size in this quality. Tubbs does sell a medium bag for 30&#34; snowshoes but I was unable to find it on Amazon.<br /><br />This bag is strong and has one tiny inside pocket that would hold a flip phone, money, or Chapstick. Although the interior will fit other items such as a change of clothes, jacket, etc.; those items would be mixed in with the snowshoes and perhaps would get damaged by them.<br /><br />The side of the bag has two Velcro straps for holding the snowshoe / trekking poles. What I don't like about these straps (or any straps like these) is that the poles will slip down. I actually clip my poles into a spacer and that spacer catches onto the top strap so that they don't slip down.<br /><br />The other side has a handle so that it can be carried like a guitar case. It also has backpack straps which is the way I prefer to carry my snowshoes.<br /><br />I attached two pictures of the bag without the poles and one with the poles attached. Note that I am unable to collapse my poles so I leave them extended. However, the best way to travel with the poles on this bag is to collapse them first before strapping them on. I also attached a picture of the back of the bag that shows the backpack handles and side handle.",0.7519,364,33.09090909090909,0.5,1.97557

"I ordered the XL vest and it fits perfectly over my jacket. I normally wear a large to an extra-large shirt so on a large man, this actually might not fit.<br /><br />When fastening the vest, I had to be careful that the Velcro was secured well as it is strong and will damage fleece and other similar material. I originally fastened the &#34;spring&#34; wrist bracelets above my wrist on the lower arm but it fell off easily and I almost lost one.  I then put them around my wrist at the base of my clothing and it stayed fine. I do not recommend they be used over clothing because they sort of &#34;unspring&#34; when moving around in the jacket. I fastened the Velcro leg bracelets around my lower calf and they stayed put. The carry bag provided can be used to store these items. I use this to walk with a friend at night and she commented as to how extremely reflective all the gear was when the car headlights hit it.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The vest is thin and a bit expensive for what you get but if it protects me from being hit in the dark it's worth it.",0.9414,251,27.88888888888889,0.5,2.03242
"I purchased a black pair of these gloves at Marshall's for $4.99 ($10 off the current Amazon price) so that I have something reflective on when I walk in the dark of night. Although, I do wear blinking lights on my backpack and one on my cap, I wanted something for the body other than wearing a vest.<br /><br />On the positive side, these gloves are thin but have a felt interior that keeps my hands warm when walking. They are like texting gloves but without any finger slots. Four fingers slip through the top and the thumb through the side and all fingers remain exposed. What I don't like about them is that both my friend who I walk with and I do not find these particularly illuminating. When a car's headlights hit them, the design on the gloves are supposed to reflect back. However, they are only mildly reflective in my opinion. Had I known this I actually wouldn't have purchased them even at the low price of $4.99.<br /><br />On the other hand, if one wants texting gloves without finger holes for four fingers, then this will do fine. For what I purchased them for, I am disappointed. I think it best to invest in a reflective vest instead. I decided to purchase this [[ASIN:B01E68SUVM Fluorescent Green vest]] since these gloves are not satisfactory for that purpose.",0.9379,278,25.272727272727277,0.2,1.14137
"This is a 2.4 lux/4 lumen rain proof and splash proof bicycle taillight which takes 2 AAA batteries (not included). These batteries should provide 36 hours of illumination according to the package.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this light. First, it's practically impossible to remove the cover to insert the batteries. There's a notch at the bottom of the light that is used to open the compartment. I had to use a letter opener to pry it open while squeezing the top a bit. The force that had to be used damaged the plastic around the notch but did not affect the light's functionality. There are four plastic prongs that hold the top reflector onto the base and I can see these prongs breaking when opening or closing the compartment to replace the batteries.<br /><br />I have a Trek bike and it was difficult to position on my bike because the height of the light got in the way of the reflector that was already there. However, the mounting bracket is a typical bracket that clenches itself around the bike frame. The light clips onto the fastener and can be removed and used elsewhere, such as clipping onto a backpack or hat for use when walking.<br /><br />The light turns on via a button on the back. Only the top &#34;bulging&#34; part lights up as the bottom acts as a reflector.<br /><br />Because of the difficulty of opening this light and chance for breakage during battery replacement, I personally cannot recommend this. This is not a light I would purchase after having tried it.",-0.7114,323,29.363636363636363,0.0,0.18658000000000002
"I have being using free weights on and off for 30+ years. Due to declining stamina and lack of time, I wanted something that was easier to work with but would provide some resistance. Although this does not compare at all to free weights, it is a safer and lighter alternative.<br /><br />- This strength cord is only 43” long between the handle grips.<br /><br />- The handles are comfortable.<br /><br />- There’s not much resistance because this is the light version.<br /><br />- It comes with an exercise insert for six upper body exercises.<br /><br />- I love the purple and black color.<br /><br />- This appears to be made cheaply and I feel like it will break after extended use; however, only time will tell.<br /><br />I went through all the exercises and am disappointed that there were no lower body options when using this cord. Also, the cord is a bit too light in the sense that I would prefer more resistance.<br /><br />In summary, this works fine for light resistance toning with exercises provided for the upper body only. The user will have to search out YouTube videos or other Internet sources showing lower body workouts using resistance bands since no such exercise examples are included in the one-page guide.",0.9687,284,56.8,0.2,1.5506100000000003
"This is my sixth sleeping bag. I had two cheap bags when I was a teenager which I wore out when I use to go ""open-sky"" camping and backpacking. I then owned an expensive -15 degree Kelty down mummy sack which I absolutely loved until the zipper broke after several uses and which I returned for a refund.  As a replacement, I purchased two [[ASIN:B0007IS68I Columbia Elkhorn II Rectangular Sleeping Bags with Pillow]]  which I still have.  I decided to see if there was a better one out there in the reasonably priced category. This is why I selected this one for review.<br /><br />Therefore, I compared this Slumberjack Women's bag with the Columbia bag I love which has a snag-free zipper, a soft flannel inside, an integrated pillow and carry sack, weighs 4 pounds, measures the typical 80 x 34 inches, and is rated up to 25 degrees all for a reasonable price.<br /><br />In comparison, this Slumberjack's features are:<br />* Temperature rating up to 20 degrees Fahrenheit or -7 degrees Celsius<br />* Carry weight is 6 lbs 10 oz<br />* Fits women up to 6 feet tall (it's 80"" x 34"")<br />* It comes with a pillow pocket and a stuff sack<br />* The inside is soft-touch polyester<br />* It is designed for women (PS I have no idea how that differs from a generic sleeping bag as the size looks like a man's to me and is the same size as my Columbia and the color is not feminine.)<br /><br />LIKES:<br />- It feels warm and is roomy.<br />- The pillow pocket is a nice touch.<br />- The Velcro over the top of the zipper channel keeps the drafts away.<br />- The rectangular construction allows for two of these bags to be zipped together.<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br />- The sleeping bag is heavy at almost 7 pounds (my Columbia is 4 pounds which I also consider heavy). I would not want to take this backpacking.<br />- It does not come with a pillow as there's only a pocket for one. The pocket does not function as a pillow unless stuffed with something.<br />- I was unable to roll this back into the stuff sack; instead I had to manhandle it into the sack any way I could. I think this must have been machine packed into the sack.<br />- I prefer a flannel inside to this polyester.<br />- The zipper snags easily unless I put my finger in the track to keep it away from the lining.  This is typical of many bags so it's almost a non-issue.<br /><br />In summary, unless you are backpacking and need a lighter sack, I think this is a good bag for the price even though it does not have all the features of my Columbia.  Personally, I prefer mummy sacks for the warmth and coziness; however, I would still choose my Columbia Elkhorn II over this Slumberjack. I cannot recommend this for backpacking, but where weight doesn't matter such as when camping or having a slumber party in the house or yard, then this bag is a viable contender.",0.9439,669,51.46153846153846,0.6,1.66317
"After a month-long search for a balcony chair while visiting too many different stores, I finally found this one at BJ's for $39.99.  It is a dream to sit in because the material has a lot of give which makes it very comfortable. What I also like is:<br /><br />- it has a high back and a slight recline to it<br />- there's a small cup holder (more for a soda can than anything else) that easily folds out from under the right side of the seat<br />- it appears to be built very sturdy<br />- it opens with ease<br />- the arm rests are comfortable and covered in foam<br />- the chair comes in a nice carrying bag<br />- the back (which looks white in the picture on Amazon) is actually clear mesh; like a pair of black pantyhose but very strong.<br /><br />The only negatives are that the chair is heavy, very tall and has a large footprint.  Originally, I purchased two of these but because of the large footprint was only able to fit one comfortably on the available space on my balcony. The fact that I kept only one of these chairs when I wanted to keep two speaks volumes since I only buy chairs in pairs.  However, this is the most comfortable lawn/balcony/beach chair I ever sat in in my life so forget about any potential visitor he or she can stand on the balcony during a visit instead.<br /><br />By the way, I must have tried over 30 beach and other folding chairs before I found this one.  In fact, I purchased a total of 3 different chairs (in sets of 2) in a state of desperation and took all of them back except for this one. The two Lifetime Comfort folding chairs I purchased at BJs for $19.99 were exceptionally sturdy but too clinical looking even though they were relatively comfortable for a straight-backed chair.  After returning those, I purchased 2 Picnic Time Portable Folding Sports Chairs in Hunter Green for $39.99 each at TJ Maxx. I almost kept those but when I saw these I bought 2 at BJs for $39.99 each and compared them to the comfort of the Picnic Time chairs. The Coleman won by a long shot.  If I had the room, I would have kept the second suspension chair as a backup. I hope this chair lasts a long, long time and is actually as sturdy as it feels.<br /><br />This was a great buy!",0.9921,505,38.84615384615385,0.3,2.3876299999999997
"I purchased the [[ASIN:B0018S4XIS Rayovac Sportsman LED Lantern (SE3DLNA)]] and this Coleman mini lantern. Both are bright but this pack away mini is great for when I need a little less light or want to carry a lantern that performs almost as well as the Rayovac but in a lot smaller package.  For instance, this would be great to carry when walking outside in the dark because it's very light (about 8 ounces) and bright and makes a person visible enough to be seen.<br /><br />What I like about this lantern is:<br />- It takes 4 AA batteries instead of the ""highly in demand"" D batteries that most flashlights use.<br />- The mini lantern fits in the palm of my hand when I collapse the LED portion into the unit.<br />- Mine came with a mini carabiner that I could hook onto the handle for easy carrying on a pant belt loop or backpack.<br />- The bottom battery compartment screws out by hand by turning the plastic grip several times until the cap came off.<br />- There are three modes of high, low, and strobe.  The low mode does not look low to me and seems very similar to high but it's supposed to save battery life.  Just pressing and releasing the top black button changes the mode.<br />- When the unit is collapsed, the light cannot accidentally be turned on which is a great feature.<br />- The unit is relatively light compared to full-sized lanterns.<br />- The package claims the LED lasts a lifetime and never has to be changed.<br /><br />I purchased this at WallMart for $19.99 plus tax ($21.39) which is $1.60 less than Amazon's current price of $22.99.<br /><br />This mini lantern suits me for small jobs and lights up my bathroom or kitchen with enough light to see without being blinding.

"I have owned a pair of  Lee Haney lifting gloves with wrist wrap for 19 years and which I used three times per week for about 12 of those years.  I still have those gloves and although they are a bit stiff, you'd never know they were used so much as they hardly look worn.  Since the Lee Haney gloves are not padded, I decided to try these gloves both because I expected an increase in comfort and as an enticement to get me back into lifting again.<br /><br />The gloves I received are a size ""Large"" and they are heavier than any other lifting gloves I've tried before; the pair weighs in at 6.2 ounces according to my dietary food scale.  However, you don't notice the weight when wearing them.  Below are the pros and cons I noticed during use:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. The gloves are well padded.  In fact, the padding is an excellent feature for when I perform lifts where the weight is in the palm of my hand, such as when doing a bench press or incline press or when the weight is evenly distributed throughout the hand such as when doing squats using a [[ASIN:B0000AVAL2 Advanced Fitness Manta Ray]].<br /><br />2. I usually take a size medium or large in a woman's glove and this size large fit me comfortably.<br /><br />3. The extra ""leather-like"" flap that you secure to the fastened wrist wrap offers extra security so that the wrap won't come undone during a lift and the gloves will remain securely fastened.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. The padding on the pinkie finger was uncomfortable for me when doing dead lifts because the bar was evenly distributed through my hand and the padding on the pinkie finger seemed to get in the way.  It almost caused a pressure point of discomfort during each entire lift (ascent and descent).<br /><br />2. The wrist wrap was awkward to fasten because not only did I have to wrap the strap around my wrist, but then I had to flip over the ""leather-like"" flap and make sure it fastened to the Velcro on the back of the flap.<br /><br />3. I was bothered by the white tag inside the right glove during lifting.  Perhaps the manufacturer could either leave the tags out or put them on the non-Velcro portion of the wrist wrap.<br /><br />4. I don't like that the two pieces of fabric used to fasten the glove to the cardboard insert it came with remain sewed to the glove.  Basically, the gloves arrive with two tags on each glove that fastens to the cardboard packaging. Those tags remain as part of the glove and to me they are annoying as I see no reason to ever use those tags again.<br /><br />I do think that if men are considering purchasing these gloves, they might want to consider ordering the next size up.  My boyfriend always takes a size ""Large"" in men's gloves and he had to struggle to get these size Large gloves on his hands.<br /><br />These gloves are thick and although they feel well-made they don't look well-made on close inspection. Therefore, I'm concerned that the stitching on the padding may come loose.  When comparing these gloves to my Lee Haney gloves, I doubt they will last as long but only time will tell.<br /><br />If padding is important, then these gloves offer that and certainly cushion the lifter during many lifts. However, for me I can only give these gloves an average rating because of the cons and my concern that the stitching around the padding will come loose.",-0.7746,762,36.285714285714285,1.0,1.2676200000000002
"Based on the other reviews, I expected to be extremely disappointed in this Altus Fitness Hoop.  However, I absolutely adore this product because assembly is easy (see ASSEMBLY CAUTION note below) and since the hoop is weighted it is easy to keep going while doing the regular ""hula hoop"" motion.  The hoop also has an all foam exterior so it cushions the impact on your mid-section.<br /><br />I was able to do the traditional core excercise for 20 minutes straight without a problem.  The only issue I had was that my mid-section felt sore because of the constant weight that was rotating around my stomach and waist. (The instructions warn of this for first time users.)<br /><br />The hoop is a bit large and you have to use all the alternating color segments when assembling, so you can't make it smaller.  It is about about 2-3 inches larger in circumference than my regular adult hula hoop which fit snugly inside the circumference of this hoop.  As a result, I had to use this in the parking lot of my condo complex because I had no room in the house.  This resulted in some spectators, of course.<br /><br />Besides doing my core exercise in public, I also tried to do the arm exercises with the hoop.  However, due to the weight I was unable to; but then again I never used a hula hoop any other way other than on my hips and that is all I wanted this for.<br /><br />Other than the soreness I felt due to the rotating weight, this hoop is lots of fun.  I can't vouch for the claim that it will imporve core strength and trim your waist, but I suppose that it might if you do it longer enough over a couple of months. When I hula my movement is very subtle so I doubt I'm burning more than a few calories.  However, if you really gyrate when you hula, then you'll get more of a workout with this device.<br /><br />ASSEMBLY CAUTION:  The assembly instructions that came with this product are extremely poor. The way to assemble this hoop so that it does not come apart is to insert each segment into the previous segment and make sure that the ""segment's release button"" for each segment on your RIGHT is slightly protruding under the foam where the button connector dots are located for each segment on the LEFT. To test, twist (in an up and down motion) the left and right segments you just connected and also try to pull the segments in the opposite direction.  If neither segment twists or pulls apart, then they are securely connected.  Repeat this procedure for each segment of the hoop.  Not once did this hoop fall apart on me. However, had I not done the twist and pull test, it would have fallen apart repeatedly because it takes some finagling to get each segment in place securely. Although this hoop is easy to assemble it still took me about 10-15 minutes to assemble the entire hoop since I made about 4 attempts and 4 tests per left and right segment to get the segments securely connected so they wouldn't fall off no matter how hard I pulled or twisted.<br /><br />May 14 Update:  I've been using this hoop every day except one for over a week now and still love it.  It has not come apart once.  Due to the weight of the hoop hitting against my body on rotation, I did develop a one inch bruise on my right hip. Other than this brusie I don't have any negative effects and the soreness I experienced when I used it the first time has gone away completely.  I absolutely love this fitness hula hoop.  Although I don't think I'm losing any weight from this, I find it a lot of fun and it's worth it just for that.  One caveat - if you have cats (or dogs), don't leave the hoop where they can reach it.  I put mine by the door a few minutes before I went out with it and my cats chewed through the soft foam on one segment of the hoop.  The foam is easily destructible.",0.9937,819,29.25,0.1,2.3281099999999997
"My boyfriend ordered one of these for his Globe bike and I tried it and love it.  I just ordered two of these for my two bikes.<br /><br />What's nice about this mirror is that you velcro it on to any handlebar.  The mirror also swivels so that when you shift with the handlebar you can adjust it.  Since my bikes are Trek automatics, I don't have to use the handlebar to shift so I won't encounter this issue.<br /><br />The size of the mirror is sufficient enough to view behind you.  I also like that you can constantly mount and unmount this mirror from your bike to prevent breakage during bike rack transport. The easy mount and unmount of the mirror  puts it at greater risk of being stolen, however.<br /><br />Having a bike mirror is a safety issue and in my opinion this is a good buy especially because it's so easy to mount and unmount.",0.9592,191,31.83333333333333,0.2,2.34776
"This bike bag is reasonably priced and provides adequate storage for wallet, keys, and a few other items.  The reason I am disappointed is because it does not fit my bike (my bike is a Trek Lime).  There is a back strap that is supposed to go behind the handlebars but the strap is so loose and cannot be tightened much so it just sags and provides no support.  Also, the straps did not securely fit the curvature of my bike handles that when I cinched it to the handlebars it drooped down almost to the front tire.<br /><br />Therefore, I tried to use this bag by cinching it to the rail above the pedals.  The fit was awkward and once I filled the pack with a cell phone and keys, it expanded and hit my legs when riding.  I decided to give this to my boyfriend--he loves it because it fits his bike fine.<br /><br />Although this is a decent pack for a good price, the manufacturer needs to improve on the back strap so that it can be adjustable by more than a few inches.  Also,buyers need to be aware that they may not be able to cinch this pack to their handlebars because of where the velcro straps are in relationship to the curvature of the handlebar.",0.4314,254,36.285714285714285,4.7,2.73942

"It was difficult to do many of the moves that I am used to doing with a barbell with this weight. Also, the tube is opaque, so you can't see the water level. You're just guesstimating the weight of the water you've added by holding the tube, which is useless. To top it off, I received a defective product that wouldn't drain the water once added. I returned for a refund, but even if my product didn't have that defect, I would still have been dissatisfied with the item and wanted to return. I don't recommend.",-0.7725,114,19.0,0.0,0.56825
"TLDR, the CRZ Yoga leggings are much, much better and the same price.<br />These leggings fit very strangely. I am 5'4"", 140 lb, wide frame. I sized up per recommendations and ordered a large. The hips were slightly loose (I must be between sizes), the thighs fit fine (I have thick thighs), calves were loose, and these were WAY too long. Like, multiple inches of bagginess. These leggings also came in at a disadvantage of being tried on at the same time as the CRZ leggings, which are a gift from the heavens. Definitely returning these.",0.872,123,17.571428571428573,0.0,1.0616
"I got this to supplement a full stepper with two sets of risers that I already own. The risers from my original stepper have a smooth contour to the top. These risers’ edges are more sharp; however, they are compatible with my other stepper/risers and stack fine. The sharpness does matter: I add and reduce risers at different parts of my workout and when I go to add risers, these risers’ edges are uncomfortably sharp against my palm. Moving forward I think I need to use these risers on the bottom and my old risers on the top so that I’m handling these risers less often. The platform piece is as described and smoothly contoured.",0.4767,129,21.5,1.9,2.3130100000000002

"I LOVE this water bottle.  I didn't know if I would like the straw function at first and I absolutely do. It is easy to drink out of the bottle using the chug hole even with the straw spout. At first, I forgot about the straw spout and started to drink out of the chug hole and I spilled water on myself because I didn't cover the straw hole with my mouth lol. But you get used to it. I also love that you carry it with the strap attached to the very top of the cap; it is very easy to pick up and carry this way. Every component of the bottle is very appealing to touch, from the bottle to the cap to the carrying strap. It is also really pretty; I've gotten lots of compliments on it. I bought a clear plastic cover for the bottom to stop the clanging when you put it down. I've been using this for 2-3 months and it looks as nice as when I bought it, which is saying something. Also the capacity is perfect for me: just enough to not have to keep refilling all the time, but not too much to be too heavy to carry around. I also LOVE that it fits in a standard cup holder, which other water bottles of the same capacity sometimes do not.  It is pricey for a water bottle but if you're a daily user like I am it is totally worth it. Highly recommend!!",0.9956,281,18.73333333333333,0.2,2.35868

"I have been using this chair for a few weeks at my desk at work.  I like it.  As someone who is fairly fit and does an hour of ab work most weeks, I honestly can't say that I notice a drastic difference in my ab toning or how my abs feel after using this chair for hours a day.  The difference I can notice is in my posture.  My back used to hurt so much because I got in the bad habit of crossing my legs and leaning to one side, one forearm bracing my body using one arm of an office chair.  Ouch.  I knew I had to eliminate a stable backrest and armrests to retrain my posture, and I wanted to challenge my seated body more than in a basic office chair.<br /><br />All around, this is a great chair.  I love the rolling feature.  I followed a suggestion of another reviewed to inflate to about 12&#34;, wait a day, then inflate further.  It worked.  Fully inflated, the height is 23&#34;, which is what I needed.  I am 5'4&#34; but my computer screen is mounted high off of my desk.  The backrest is almost useless at my height, to be honest.  I would never sit so far back in the chair to have my back touch the rest.  Sometimes if I have been seated for several hours, my upper back will begin to hurt out of strain, so I will lean far back for a few moments.  Also, it is good to use to stretch if twisting.  If I had known what I know now, I would have opened my search to models without backrests.  Alas.  This chair is fine.<br /><br />Women:  I wear dresses that hit 1-2&#34; above my knee most days.  I had no problem sitting on this chair.  I work in an enclosed L-shape desk and I have spread my legs a little when sitting in this chair, but I haven't found it absolutely necessary or most comfortable.  I can see how you gain great stability with widespread legs, but I'm most naturally inclined to have my legs straight in front of me.  I can easily meet with someone seated across from me with my legs closed without feeling unstable.  The one caveat to this is high heels-- I'm not talking about 1&#34; wedges, but 2&#34;+ and pointies-- it will be less sturdy to navigate and you may feel compelled to spread your legs to gain your balance.<br /><br />Additional info from several months of use: You definitely expend more energy sitting on this bad boy. I came down with the flu and my first day back in office I sat down for a few moments and knew I wasn’t strong enough to stay in this chair.",0.9912,562,22.48,2.2,2.95736
"I wanted a larger water bottle for use at my workplace because I found that I was running low on water too often and was too busy (or, admittedly, too lazy) to take the 2 minute walk to refill my water bottle, leaving myself thirsty and dehydrated at my desk for hours.  In doing my research for a worthy substitute, I was really attracted to this water bottle.  I loved the company's sustainable values and how well-made their product seemed.<br /><br />When I received the water bottle, I was surprised how lightweight on it is on its own; of course, it gets heavy when you fill it with 40 oz of water, which I wish that I had the foresight to realize before I made this purchase.  It is so heavy and wide that I need to use two hands to pick up and drink out of when it is full.  The other noticeable thing about the bottle is its beautiful color.  I bought it in aqua and it is so eye-catching that I got two compliments on it in my small office during its first day of use.<br /><br />I did not like the style of the cap which the water bottle came with, so after doing research, I purchased another brand's water bottle cap which was HydroFlask-compatible, which I also thought should be compatible with this one.  Unfortunately, it is not.  The cap screws on, but it leaks.  Of course, this is not the fault of the brand or the water bottle, but it was disappointing to me, and if you are considering buying the bottle and swapping out the cap, this might be worth taking note of.<br /><br />When I first bought this water bottle, I intended to use it all the time to replace my current water bottle.  However, due to its hefty size and weight, I have decided to keep this bottle strictly at the office, as it is even too heavy and unwieldy to bring back and forth to my car, gym, and/or home.  I drive a little sedan and it does not fit in my cup holders.  I might be bringing it to the gym on my heavy cardio evenings, but it definitely staying in the office for pilates and barre.  And it is definitely useful to have around for camping or hiking!<br /><br />Overall great water bottle and very pleased with the product; unsure how practical it is for daily hydration use when commuting (unless you commute with a backpack).",0.9791,491,37.76923076923077,0.1,2.32373

"Ordered to replace a walking or bus transit option to school.. for a commute almost 2miles away.. This should provide enough range and capability to make commuting pretty simple and cost efficient, not too time consuming… and more adaptable to fluctuate on one’s own schedule. With a daughter attending college and living off campus- she is actually renting a place 2 miles from the school. With sunshine year-round.. this offers up the alternative to using a bus route and will allow for transportation on her own time schedule!<br /><br />Most important piece to the puzzle.. is having a bike lane or sidewalk that allows for electric scooters- it was only after seeing someone else commuting in the same capacity.. this idea became brilliant! Having the ability to lock it down, and even provide light as needed- it’s a fun and cost-effective way for commuting!  Because of the app, this will allow the ability to have control of perks like lockdown, headlight, ride assist.. and keeps us from needing a car to help her get around college town!!<br /><br />The downside is weather related, of course.. but in sunny California, this should be minimal. The other drawback of course is taking someone with you.. BUT, it allows for her backpack to securely be put in place and she can even fold down the handle bar to create a carry option inside the building. She does this during her one evening class for safety reasons.Plugging in each night- provides her the range needed the following day. Only using for the last x10days- she’s not noticed any difference in speed a drive ability.. and this is been with a lot of playing around by herself and others… A LOT!!  Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe, everyone!<br /><br />Ps. Be cognizant of helmet laws where you live- no one wants a ticket or an accident that could harm them!

"As most graduate and move on post college they tend to still feel their pride in their alma mater.. especially on game rival day!

Made of a thick polyester with sturdy reinforced edges and solid grommets to string up a flag pole if desired.. it’s truly made to be displayed in a variety of ways.. hung on a balcony, up inside a window, or.. even as a tapestry on a wall- it’s the perfect size 3x5’ for multi uses- and built to withstand both, indoor or outdoor climate!<br /><br />Ordering in February.. I cannot speak for sun bleaching on the deep red color- I’m sure it may fade bc deep red usually does.. But, it’s something that could possibly be avoided by taking down at night, finding indirect sun exposure or.. just to be anticipated! Bc of its deep coloring- it seems reasonable that it would take quite a bit of time to fade out the deep color! Letting one get their $ worth.<br /><br />Big and bold print is nicely displayed with infamous Utes “U” logo and accent colors.. easy to read and see from afar.

Having a daughter grow up, playing the game.. all the way to becoming a college coach today- we’ve bent one to many needles by leaving it connected!! Just a word of advice from a veteran mama!<br /><br />Solid stitching brings confidence to the balls ability to withstand wear and tear. Definitely unisex in purpose… however, with its fuchsia/pink  presence it may feel too feminine for male ballers- some social norms may think so! Great gift for any soccer enthusiast and one that could be used for just having fun, practice or game day.. bc, it is regulation size! $20 price point is respectable for the set- Hoping info helps your decision.. stay safe everyone.",0.9926,233,23.3,0.0,2.29778

"A wild idea- indoor trampoline if you have space! Ideal for Utah winters with kids inside months at a time! Needs 5ft. circumference for the item PLUS x2 ft. excess space surrounding!

After doing research, I found the information..<br /><br />I found that the code arrives set on straight zeros… if for some reason #’s have shifted, slide them back and then eject the pin. From there- look ant the end you insert the pin.. it has a “set arrow” for you to twist. Turn each dial to the number chosen for your personal combination - WRITE IT DOWN! Then, twist out of the setting position- and done. Probably a better way to explain would be including instructions with photos from the manufacture.. but Im hoping this may make some sense!?<br /><br />Lock itself feels decent. Keeping in mind any lock is hackable!! I’d only recommend attaching to something else that was solid/stationary or… Use on a bike with an alarm if your so lucky… So if someone tried to remove, it was set off of warning. The chain fibers would take some heavier hardware to get thru- But again, it’s relative… Not something that most of us would have in our household tool repertoire to break through but people that commit this type of crime prob. have invested in this type equipment.<br /><br />I would say this is a lock used in situations where item can be well observed by the community and its surroundings. Would be a nice option, taking a bike to school during the day.. and has potential to step up- unfortunately, nothing will be full proof! This has ability to deter and if equipped with instructions, it would step it up a whole other level.",0.8409,364,26.0,0.0,1.4522700000000002
"Wow.. awesome beginner set!! Perfect for those interested in trying their hand at the trendy pickle ball rage. Great idea for a family gift or  something to send off with your college kiddo, equipped for x4 players makes it a great social activity.<br /><br />Compared next to a pro racquet that cost us x2 the price- Im not seeing much of a difference!? This feels solid yet still lightweight.. which is nice for wrist fatigue. Nothing cheap or fragile in structures and offers a firm comfort grip- complete with protected edges. What’s crazy- is for this price you receive x4 racquets of this same caliber..<br /><br />Icing on the cake is the included storage bag. Very nicely made- this lets you transport and store safely.. We leave set in trunk of the car- So, whenever a game can be played we’re ready! Everything inside bag is nice, neat and contained. For price point you’ll get a solid starter set.. one that can step up. Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone.",0.9952,211,21.1,0.0,2.29856
"Surprised at how soft and inviting this is- does NOT feel like a sleeping bag.. this has more of an airy silky feel and feels amazing against the skin- total comfort 5*. You won’t believe how lightweight either, not even as heavy as a Coke can- it gets another 5*..!! I had no issue folding down and getting blanket back into its sleeve and that was done on first attempt- 5* for packing. (trick is expelling the excess air prior to inserting!)<br /><br />Ordered in the rocky mtn. print.. it seemed a little less detailed than expected- but, comparing side-by-side to photo.. it’s just bc of large size photo- best viewed laid out flat I’d give it 4*. Overall size is more than adequate for x2 to either picnic or lay sleeping bags on. Ample room to totally engulf x1 adult with ease.. 5* for all size aspects..<br /><br />Surpassing all of the above expectations- I was surprised in amount of fill.. it was less than expected, especially if to bring added cushion and comfort for sleeping upon. I find this has solid quality, craftsmanship and all attention to detail to be sturdy + withstand wear/tear. Just know.. this won’t be a surplus of cushion on lumpy ground- unless it’s doubled over and used by a single person.. this I’d rate 3.5* for amount of fill or, lack of. Having said that- I do understand the reasoning to why it has the amount it does. So to be fair it was more of my own missed expectation.<br /><br />This has merit for giftability use- its one that will be around for a long time.. greater for campers, hikers, outdoor enthusiast, etc.. Definitely a higher price point… You’re paying for its on the go abilities. Along with quality materials and craftsmanship used. Not so much a dense or full bottom layer.

Material is pleasant not plastic feel- realistically fits x3-4 adult with elbow room or 5.5 close/snug!<br /><br />Bright colors are easy to spot in crowded space..

"Finally.. hand warmer made for two hands- imagine that?!!  Most designs are a single warmer only this offers up a “2 handed” solution.. heat/used as one unit or two separate for both hands or pockets. Delivers double the warmth..!!<br /><br />Size is ideal just ann oval egg- perfect for front pant pockets, jacket side pockets or even the kangaroo style pocket found on a hoodie.. unfortunately, these are too big to slip into a glove! (See photos included of size comps above from all angles..) Shape cups nicely into palm of hands- easy to find a natural/comfort fit.<br /><br />Charged overnight, these are ready for the day! These must be puzzle connected to charge both sides.. so, follow instruction insert bc it’s beyond easy. *Lowest heat option = lasts longest. X3 levels feel comparable to basically: heat or no heat!! Full charge realistically lasts 8hrs.<br /><br />Idea like that of disposable hand warmer.. but will provide a more lucrative source of heat.. My daughters a college coach and sidelines get cold in rain/snow + standing still!! Tucked in a pocket these generate heat to keep chill away..A perfect gift that comes boxed and ready to go! Ideal for athletes, winter dog walk, outdoor work, winter sport fan, ski lift operator etc.  A little heat goes a long way for comfort!!

As a collegiate athlete she has early + late practices x5 days a wk- often she encounters dark going to/from. This presented need for extra safety.. and the set gave options!! Even flashlight to help light path..<br /><br />My other lives alone with career and her side hustle walking dogs who impose a diff. type threat of dog entanglement scenarios.. after this did occur-it was vital to have a defense measure! Also with coyotes in urban area.. and a few risky encounters- she felt it smart to have a plan B and this set was it!!!<br /><br />Whether living home or alone- if you find situation compromising.. this brings peace of mind. It is item you’ll most likely never use- but can aid in dire circumstances.. WHY NOT?!<br /><br />Taser has belt strap for easy carry- mine ran it thru a lanyard so, easy to get to but keeps user hands free. Big as a king sz. candybar- it’s lightweight and however transported.. if you charge all night- it’s ready when you are! Sound makes “zap” like a bug zapper! Sounds silly but can startler person/animal along with the surprise taser shock!! Easy to use if in close contact- has touch button trigger! From “air trying” Im sure it doesn’t feel good. What you need is noise or “diversion moment” to get free…<br /><br />Pepper spray can hook onto keys, etc- ergonomic fit to the hand + flap to protect an accidental spray. Rules are simple.. Use in close contact of face, eye, mouth area (preferably not down wind.) Case is solid to protect vial.

"Bought as a “trophy ball” for my daughter who recently hung up her competitive cleats after a childhood training for a scholarship. Completing her degree and x4yrs. of countless accolades such as athlete of the year- she’s become a university’s youngest coach on staff! Whew.. I wanted a true  memorabilia ball worthy to mark the occasion and Dream Goal was the perfect choice!! The look is quality.. it’s geometric design is artistic and full of solid craftsmanship. Color combos are great- love the black/white.. it would look perfect on a shelf.<br /><br />Ha- I should’ve known better!! Upon gifting it to her- The first thing she did was put this ball into action! Said a ball that great cannot sit idle on a shelf.. and I can’t give a better endorsement than that!! Things that matter such as even balance, no lopsided weave/wobble and hand finished quality are all on point. Has solid interior air bladder and weighed to official NCAA game standards.. if filled appropriately as intended, it was 0.05oz off from official measuring unit- which is considered game ready and worthy!<br /><br />For a quality ball under $30- this is a fantastic find. Great for any avid fan or player.. definitely a ball made with merit! Hoping info helps your decision- stay safe everyone.",0.9967,268,20.615384615384617,0.0,2.29901
"Solid balance bike- one that feels sturdy and brings confidence in its overall structure.. light blue has a retro feel. Bike has easy construction and one just needs to attach the seat with included tool and you’re ready to go! Note: Seat can be adjusted up or down.. photos included show seat at its lowest level- still a bit too high for our 31 mo. old..<br /><br />I also compared photos of the balance bike sized just below this bike.. and you can see it is a large jump up in size! Wish there was a size in between.. bike is light and easy to control, its one a toddler can hold up under his own merit. Solid tires compiled of materials vs. air means no flat tire to worry about. Spongy neoprene handles help grip- but the issue comes in the ability to touch the ground!! Leg length is too short- this is from a toddler in the 53% for height and weight so, I expect it to be the same results for others as well…<br /><br />*while learning to balance- bike can be used indoors.. if it hasn’t gone outside to dirty tires first. Something I’d suggest mastering prior to outdoor concrete!<br /><br />The only structural issue or change id prefer to see- is the foot pegs to rest feet on be a bit bigger. With a toddlers dexterity it’s hard for them to balance feet on the tiny 1x1” platforms. The feet struggle to find the spot and stay put.. I am hoping as he ages up this will fix itself.<br /><br />A great gift and fun way to entertain and promote healthy exercise.. this can grow with a child and has integrity to last while they size out of riding bike.

Pants can hold their own- appropriate for a day in the office, corporate meeting, interviews, court… Anything professional or dressier!!<br /><br />Slick material has a nice sheen that only adds to a dressy vibe.. along with pleats down front. Straight leg cut seems to aesthetically lengthen the leg line.. and pant looks fantastic with a heel! Yet, the length wasn’t too long for one who’s 5’6”, 123lb, 23x30, 34B, 25yr old.. size small fit as expected. High waisted will show plenty of whiskering type wrinkles around bends and pockets- the poly fabric likes to hold onto wrinkles a bit.. but wont appear sloppy or disheveled bc of it.<br /><br />Keep in mind- this is a “throwback” style and not the current trend worn low on the hip!! Take note of style- higher waist and looser trouser cut. These have room to move with you while bring comfort while worn.. but, nothing is fitted from waist down!<br /><br />Sold at higher price point bc of quality material and craftsmanship.

Not the most ideal… But it works!!<br /><br />Set up in under a minute.. simply push the front spikes firmly into the ground and these hold steady.. even with wind- it will blow right through.

Also good for breaking up a larger number of kids into smaller groups of x4. options are endless.. perfect for PE class, recess, coaching or private lessons- any need to visually see marked spot or boundary.<br /><br />Best part of all.. discs are bendable plastic- almost silicone. These won’t snap or crack under accidental step or pressure as they definitely have forgiveness!! For any who use- you know how nice it is to have durability! I would not call these delicate or fragile.. Set included a metal stand to leave out and collect/hold all discs- but also includes a pullstring travel bag which is so nice to keep pieces contained!

Overall square is just a tad smaller.. basically, the new square fits inside the perimeter of the original- barely! (Tbh, not sure anyone would truly take notice or in most cases, care..)<br /><br />All seams stitched nicely and reinforced. No leaking of beads or product of any kind..no gapes or holes- these are fully enclosed on all x4 sides.. and after using in over a dzn. “family friendly tournaments” still no rip/tears.. bags have stayed fully intact, even playing on concrete.<br /><br />The only noticeable difference comes in exterior material used to make the bag! In leuí of one side being suede or rougher type felt- this is the same slick material on both sides!! Most sets I’ve played with have a smooth AND rough option to ea. bag- that lets you use different techniques in the “toss and slide” approach! With this consisting of a 100% smooth exterior.. It just eliminates that aspect of the game.<br /><br />The reason I deducted x1 star is its regulation claim -with bag 0.5”² smaller and all-over smooth fabric exterior vs. dual sided.. these are perfect for fun replacement in friends/family use but technically- not identical to original set.

Besides- a bucket list item- complete!!)<br /><br />As a smaller female.. knife had solid ergonomic fit in my hand. Grip felt firm with textured handle.. I thought texture was for aesthetics only!!

We’re trying x1 to share for now- successful, Hmm? ..to be continued!<br /><br />Visiting my girls- I got to try my hand (or should I say foot!) on this board- a bit unnerving! Meeting an avid rider on the beach who took pity on me- we began to talk shop! Good news is: said our set was rock solid! Above all he admired strength in board itself- No worry of fold/collapse in use.. whew! Said extra bungee straps, D ring, molded carry handle.. all good perks. ONLY upgrade suggested in time- was the paddle.. said smaller flipper is x2 as much work- and quality may not last like board will. He pointed out- you want a paddle to float and this one doesn’t 100%. Gave out double ended style idea (ie. Kayak) allows more versatility.. otherwise, set got stamp of approval from a “real rider!!”<br /><br />As for my thoughts: at 5’2”/145lb. board size felt plenty big.. girls are 5’6-7”/130lb.’s and they too felt confident. Board felt like a tiny floating island- I tried standing, then kneeling ha ha.. only wish it had extra pad for my knees! (I used my towel but not ideal.) We ONLY used 2 outer fins below for balance.. like you can choose! All parts stay safe in storage bag. We left board inflated.. it looks so cool!

I want fold and carry, sort of one and done! Last trip I decided to carry back to car and fuss with folding later.. (Hmm, yes I was that girl!) heaving a heavier chair back to the car I found it wasn’t easier.. and the weight isn’t the lightest!! Next time I’ll fold it before I go- I promise.<br /><br />Heavier weight equates to the solid foundation and materials used. This has integrity and doesn’t field to give way under weight of user- at 140lb. I had 28lb toddler on my lap climbing.. and chair was a solid 10. Husband used as well- he’s 210lb. and had same results.. just note the integrity is there.<br /><br />Loved the extra perks! A functioning drink holder.. able to hold hydro.. cushioned arm rests.. and sleek colors with matching bag- better price point under $50. Being of lower profile I appreciate ability to set at the waters edge and let h2o lap onto feet to cool you off. Height is great for kids and shorter peeps (being only 5’1” I qualify!) But, as low as this is.. it may be problematic for elderly or any knee or back issues- something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Overall- it’s a solid with far more perks vs. quirks..

"A x4 pack of a thinner wool sock.. these bring comfort and provide those useful qualities.. like the moisture wicking we know and love from wool!<br /><br />Being thin- socks still provide coverage at the foots tender spots making them a solid choice for hiking, camping, horse riding, any rigorous activity. The wool wicks to help avoid rubbing and create sore spots + blisters at points of contact. Wool absorbs vs. disperses sweat into shoe etc. *It’s good to allow washed feet air exposure post using. If prone to athletes foot- one can use talc powder as a preemptive measure.. especially between toes and underneath! (If worn on long treks or expeditions!)<br /><br />Being thin.. these may wear thru sooner vs. later- however, the wool blended with a synthetic may help support longevity- at a price point of $15 its on point for product received. Elastin is not tight nor compressing but keeps sock in place- we had no issue with sock sliding off into the shoe!<br /><br />FYI: it’s always best to hand wash wool socks and air dry them! A little woolite or liquid detergent in a sink will do the trick and hang them to dry.

"Ordered to use on a visit to see my daughter who’s become quite a pickle ball enthusiast.. i was in need of a racket- But, without ever playing was a gamble- I was wanting something worthy yet, not breaking the bank.. and these were perfect! For any who’s new to the sport- this is a great find.. surprisingly solid and still so lightweight, I was a master at the craft- and I’m giving credit to the racket!! A bit retro in appearance it looked stylish on the court- i’m finding most of these are done with wild colors.. this color scheme grabbed plenty of complements!<br /><br />After swapping to try a fiberglass + metal trimmed option- I found I favored this racquet far better.. it feels easier on the wrist- and although these are all relatively lightweight.. this made a solid difference yet, performed with just as much strength. The only drawback is not smacking the end into the ground- This didn’t happen.. it was just advised by a fellow baller who said- wood can split/chip if so!!! Just a little something to keep in mind- and playing in seattle they also informed me to be certain bracket is 100% dry prior to storing in its travel bag and so, I’m passing both these tips along to ya’ll as well!<br /><br />Love this comes in a set ready to play- 2 blankets and four balls all in a travel conch sac!

Even warmth of sunny California couldn’t melt the ice all day! I had this up mtn. hiking trails, in Cali. car traffic for hours.. a day at the beach, you name it. Ice was still intact all day + liquid cold!!! (filled 2/3 ice each morning!)<br /><br />32oz. size is really ideal especially if refilling is not easily accessible.. the space is built into the height so, bottle can fit inside car cup holder or backpack sleeve. A true Goldilocks size- not too big or small! Ohh, and the widemouth!!! Opening makes loading ice such an easy task (and lemon slices too!) No need for special shape/sized ice cube trays or chiseling cubes to create a size to fit inside bottle!! (tbh, I never realized this was the purpose behind a widemouth top- now we all know- ha!!) wide mouth is easy to clean- I rigorous soapy scrub with a bottle brush and you’re home free.<br /><br />Hands down my favorite feature is the built-in loop on the lid..!!! This allows connection to carabiner etc. without the fear it will snap off. Personally, I like to hook this through my finger when I need semi hands-free mode.. and it’s perfect. Being built in- it carries weight of the load no problem.<br /><br />Overall, this matches up with a major brand in its integrity..comparing side-by-side, I included photos to show how equally they match up.

"Color me happy… what a fun was to accessorize and refresh your old Hydro flask! An easy and harmless way to show style and flare without breaking the bank. Sold at $16 for 3 straps isn’t exactly cheap.. But, straps are double sided so you’ll get a total of 6 options… Best part of all- these are the same make and material as the original.. You’re getting top end quality for your purchase.<br /><br />As for mechanics/swapping straps: each set included one replacement key (effective so, don’t lose!) Tiny issue.. is knowing how to apply this!!? Product definitely needs to include instructions for the buyer! What seems easy enough actually has a bit of a knack involved.

"For reasons I can’t explain… These are about the most unnecessary sweetest little “mini me” knives that are to die for perfect! Total surprise how I fell instantly in love- only as one who loves tiny/quirky things.. these just put a smile on the face!<br /><br />During quarantine my adult children sought refuge in our home- (x1 high schooler, x2 in college.. and x1 residing close by) and like most of the world, we explored new past times and one of those was going rouge in the kitchen together! We all had a ball taking on a task at mealtime- cutting and chopping was a fav. (my pandemic silver lining..!!) this set allowed x1 knife for each- and my kiddos were smitten.<br /><br />The intricate detail is there start/finish- hand stitch sheathes with snap closure are perfectly fit to their tiny silver blades.. all in a different cut these have a laser etched design which is impressive.. and their detailed handles just brings it all home.  Perfect for any to keep together as a set and the little tin provided is ideal.. I gifted x1 to ea. of my x4 kiddos  to commemorate our  “cooking quarantine” and trust me, the joy was all theirs.<br /><br />Easy to connect on one’s key ring and even come in handy in the most awkward of times.. box cutter, string snipper, make shift flat edge tightener, etc. **Just be sure these are not on ones person if flying as they may not pass TSA guidelines!! We lucked out and had time to take it off daughters backpack and return to our driver!!**<br /><br />Overall, a solid $15 spent.. for a perfect little replicated set of knives to make any enthusiast happy! Quirky.. you bet- that’s half the fun!! Hoping this info helps your decision- stay safe everyone.<br />**photos included show size compared to quarter stone, intricate details, carry case and sheathes.***",0.9972,408,29.142857142857142,0.5,2.44916
"[[VIDEOID:77df6b3a35ae389d47effc1f1f9f8c]] Wow! Who knew somethings so small could give one such incredible peace of mind?!! Knowing a water bottle is a breeding ground for bacteria and germs that can lead to illness- I get it.. it makes total sense. Placing an object on/in mouth and covering it back up multiple times a day.. regardless of what temperature- Ewe!! This top will eliminate those germs prior to drinking and as needed throughout the day.. boom! Mic. Drop-<br /><br />To use: Place on h2o bottle that is top compatible, which is several bottles made in standard size- 5 of 7 bottles we owned fit this lid perfectly- but, this does NOT including hydro flask or, yeti brand- both  have different style standard tops unfortunately.. I mention in case you’re trying to match a bottle you already own. This comes with charge cord of its own kind- careful not to abuse/lose!<br /><br />Product is straightforward. A quick tap turns it on.. x2 tap and hold for sterilization- and tap and hold for 5 seconds for purification. You receive different lights to indicate which process is on and when complete. *NOTE: DONT lift finger during any command process- or, it will error and you’ll need to start again. **IF UNSURE: (and I was) the video included on Amazon website to buy the item- shows every step. TBH, I set mine up by following along making things so simple. I recommend you do the same- It’s worth it 100%..!!<br /><br />No instructions included besides steps printed on bag- i’ve included photos to show you.. (hence suggestion to watch video!) Added stickers with info are included as well. *if charger trouble they include tips as well. A few quirks in the instructing process I’m sure the company will figure out as they go. However, set it up x1… and it’s easy to use! No need to be intimidated- and this is coming from a non tech savvy mama.. the peace of mind is worth it!

"After a failed attempt at an off brand set of ankle weights.. I felt it best to trust the “big guns” when it comes to athletics and sports equipment.. Ha! Adidas didn’t disappoint- they know what they’re doing and have perfected the art.. Duh!! (Shame on me for doubting there would be a difference!)<br /><br />Compared to others- these weights are leaps and bounds more compatible to the human body.. they are not just a ring of weights with a buckle, end of story! This set has been put to the test in its design and the cut.. Wow! This actually contours with the ankle or wrist- personally, I find it best fits the ankle! But, can definitely be used on either. Using a soft material this shows attention to detail in the cut.. NO sharp edges or corners to irritate the skin. Believe me- this makes all the difference. (with my cheaper set I had cotton stuffed in my sock to combat sharp edging.. which failed me btw and was so not practical!!)<br /><br />The interior sand or gel(?) used to create the weight is evenly disbursed which also is a necessity. Placement depends on muscles strengthen appropriately- and this does it’s job in spades. Note: if unsure which size weight to order.. keep in mind user activity and length of time! Trust me, even 2-3lb. seem light.. right up until 10min. into a run, workout, or even a walk- and you will feel it adding a difference! I chose 3lb. and find it compatible for those at an intermediate workout level.<br /><br />Definitely recommend and admit its worth the extra investment to purchase a set from a trusted athletic company- you won’t be disappointed!

"Officially playing 1st game of pickle ball over the holiday while staying at a resort with a court.. We found such a fun past time that allowed for a quite the rigorous workout- imagining health benefits paired with the laughs.. the plan to continue at our health center back home. Plan was in motion- now, get the supplies!!<br /><br />Wanting an all-inclusive starting kit this was a solid choice. I am surprised how light the racket feels in one’s hand. Don’t worry! One can still hit a shot with power or finesse- its just done without excess fatigue on the wrist. The lighter weight paddle took a bit of adjusting- but loving the overall results. Best of all, this provides a perfect comfort grip and does so without sweating! Edges are finished nicely which keeps them from prematurely splitting (oh.. I still have a lot to learn!) But, I find I’m most excited about the hip art design on the paddle itself! (see photos included..)<br /><br />Set comes with x4 balls- x2 of each color.. and a carry case big enough to include x2 rackets and x4 balls. *one can even fit cellphone and ID wallet into pocket on carry bag as well.. a perfect bonus for us since we must utilize our Rec centers court- and must carry membership card. I love this one bag can keep all items safely contained. This offers 2-option for carry: an over the shoulder strap or, briefcase carry style handle (strap can easily adjust to fit child to adult sizing..)<br /><br />At a price point of $55 this is a great set to get anyone ready to play. I find the quality and value are both present and feel confident with purchase.<br />Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe.",0.9986,365,22.8125,0.1,1.92958
"Wow! Why didn’t I get this years ago.. our family enjoys the summer on our golf cart.. even though not X1 of us golfs! We use it as our summer über: pool, parades, bbqs, neighbors, firework shows, etc! Then, the utah winter shuts us down.. so we must store till spring- but, doing so we’ve always lacked a protective barrier!<br /><br />Even parked in a garage, cart encounters wear/tear, especially the paint (and having a custom painted Americana cart -this is tragic and costly!) Its just so easy to bump, pile things on, lean against..let alone freeze leather seats or, crack rubber on the tires. We took a chance on Eventronics universal cover.. and hallelujah!! I’m so glad we did.. This single handedly changed the game and cut out issues by protecting from damage by accidental contact..<br /><br />Fit is SO perfect- (see photos for size!) we have a larger double benched seat cart w/ lift kit for off road tires. Complete with hard roof, and extending side mirrors.. This cover fit as if it were tailor made! SO easy to apply- draped over top, it encompasses the entire cart and finishes with a drop skirt that provides a clip/buckle to not only tighten and personalize the fit.. it also keeps it secure-This encapsulates top to bottom, see last photo posted!<br /><br />Spending $40- to protect $7k is beyond its value in measure. Made of lighter moveable material.. this is reminiscent of a windbreaker and a crazy side effect.. with warm cars parked inside along the covered cart- this creates a convection heat system that is nothing but good for the circumstances.<br /><br />For any who find themselves in need- I recommend without hesitation. A worthy investment 100%.. one that will only help prolong quality of what it’s covering up! Hoping this info can help your decision.. stay safe.",0.9952,398,26.53333333333333,0.3,2.38856
"Bought this for my daughter living in the dorms- she has limited access at best to dishwashing.. so, not wanting to rely on hand soap in the bathroom sink- this gives the mama peace of mind!!<br /><br />Not only will this keep container from contracting germs- it can disinfect the actual water she is drinking. Dorm rooms have always been a breeding ground for germs and I’ve seen it 1st hand with other 2 kiddos- So, for once I have the upper hand.. and that huge during the Covid pandemic! The last thing I want is a child sick compromising immune system all due to avoidable bacteria exposure.. no thanks!! So, parents take note… This is one of the better investments to send your kiddo off to college with- trust me on this one!<br /><br />Love the size, Love the grip!! It’s PERFECT on both levels- bottle fits in backpack pocket and car cup holder as well. With its rubberized exterior.. this binds like one in the hand- oh, it’s easy to grip size only helps the cause! No worries… If they need a refill they can use drinking fountain, tap water etc. then, treat water and drink away! Content also stays quite cool for the better part of the day.. i’m telling you you won’t find better..!! At a price point of $40 it’s worth every cent-<br /><br />USB cords included… Although, it runs a bit short in length- just know, this can be substituted if it’s an issue.. it’s just the standard size.<br /><br />Makes a fantastic birthday, graduation, spoil yourself gift… Would be wonderful for traveling abroad.

"For any who love outdoor getaways.. and utilize the car as shelter- this is a must. This lets you make car bed as comfortable as you can…<br /><br />For those who’ve had to sleep on the seatbelt or, snuggle up to the wheel well- you get me!!! This air mattress “levels the playing field“ both, figuratively and literally! This takes a non-flat surface and fills all those quirky spaces and crevices AND covers up fixed objects such as seatbelts or seat split. With a solid 3-4” of air between you and the obstacle… You can actually sleep quite comfortably.<br /><br />A total must for the more sporadic at heart.. if you ever get the wild idea to get off the grid and stay overnight in the mtns. (I live at base of 4 diff. canyons. I can be legit camping within 20 minutes- off grid in camping heaven!!) Only one issue if last minute idea- finding open campground OR, trying to pitch a tent in the dark! Ha.. This is where car camping steps up in spades..!!! This lets you take your last minute hiatus- with no tent needed. Your SUV becomes your home away from home and this air mattress makes it perfect..<br /><br />Air mattress comes in a carry bag to keep it safely contained. At the size of a rolled sleeping bag- one can keep this in back of car, no prob. A pump is provided but, be patient.. this takes approx. 10 min. to fill. *I recommend practicing x1 at home!! This will allow all needed stretching to the mattress itself. (Think of this like a balloon.. 1st time adding air is tight.. each time you inflate, balloon stretches and just gets easier/easier.) So will this mattress! I also suggest all but overfilling- once weight is applied the air does settle into the small extra spaces.. we find if filling mattress FULL- it’s just right to sleep and stay that way thru the night. As air settles you will need to refill each night used.<br /><br />Easy to deflate- as you roll and fold.. you’ll compress and expel any leftover excess air. Yes! You can actually fit this back into carry case this way..<br /><br />For any car campers- hands down.. this is a game changer in comfort. If unsure about compatibility enter car info into your personal info. This will tell you on car items if yes/no will fit your exact vehicle.

"Ordered red medium resistance for our daughter who is a collegiate athlete and must keep her physical rigor going during summer without access to her athletic trainer or facility!! She does this on her own with her running sit ups, push-up, free weights etc.. but, having that needed resistance is hard to get.<br /><br />This band was the “Goldilocks” of what she was after- something solid enough to gain a good strenuous challenge during her sets and reps- all without being too easy or far too difficult to work up a sweat and truly make an impact.<br /><br />Grip is soft and comfortable.. no pinch or pressure points to cause sores (even using x4-5 per week!) Sized adequately for even a smaller female to get a solid hold around handle easily. The wrapped padding is done with a stronger foam- we’ve even washed these: using a simple hand soap we thoroughly rinsed and then, air dried overnight.. Good as new the next day!<br /><br />Without solid numbers listed for use- I best equate the bands as such: 1-low 2- medium 3- high- if measured in weight: 0-6lb for low, 7-11lb for med, 12+lb for high… (I know, I know- it’s not how it’s measured! just trying to provide comparison- if you know weight arena youre comfortable with- you can choose band accordingly!) Hoping this info can help you in your decision.. stay healthy and safe!<br /><br />**I first ordered a band in the famous US sport brand.. FYI- this Reebok resistance band performs every bit to the same level/quality (just 1/3 the $..)",0.995,331,55.16666666666666,0.5,2.0485
"SOO PRETTY!! This pink Pearlescent is absolutely gorgeous… And yes I’m talking about a yoga ball!!? I love the set is all inclusive… If you’ve never used a stand for yoga ball… Once you do, you won’t go back- it helps with balance and allows one to be a bit more “daring/flexible“ without angst of the ball slipping. Stand is a “click together” circular structure that once connected stays secure and actually takes effort to undo- it wont come apart otherwise.. which is exactly what you want from a stand.. stable + stationary!<br /><br />The ridged ball serves a purpose which is something some don’t know about! This has “small ridges” (a few inches apart) that circumference the ball. These help keep a person in place when using (sort of like tire tread although, it’s not grabby!) I see this very beneficial for any who may need a little extra help ie. hindered with Injury, elderly or, just need or lack natural balance..<br /><br />Although this has a hand pump- be prepared for it to take you a lot of effort/time to inflate- the better part of an hour.. (especially with 75cm size!!) This has a thick outer surface to keep it from puncture/bursting- which is nice to give peace of mind. This has an internal air bladder in case exterior puncture takes place.. it’s made to “break ones fall“ to the ground and let you down slower- so to speak (again, peace of mind!) But, in order to perform accurately- this must be filled taut!! and you’ll be surprised how long this can keep filling to get there. TBH, we ended up using electric pump to make quicker work of the task.. younger with more muscle may not find this as tedious. Just note: this is also compatible with an electric pump and worth getting it out for the job!!<br /><br />Overall, X1 of better all inclusive sets I’ve seen- it has such an eye on quality and safety Im so impressed. Sold at $22- without hesitation I’d recommend 100%. You won’t find better..!! Hoping this info can help your decision… Stay safe!",0.9946,455,25.27777777777778,0.2,2.35838
"Good quality adidas band- this is a solid workout item.. made of 100% quality material and solid stretch. Handles allow a firm grip around comfort from the padding.<br /><br />The issue had- this stretches out well over 5 feet.. so, for someone 5’2”.. it is hard to get enough resistance.. The only way to do so is attach it to an item and do a one-sided stretch at a time-and this eliminates some of the muscles one can work!<br /><br />Note: level one would definitely be for beginners! If you do have athletic capabilities… This does not provide a lot of strenuous resistance to work up too. So, know what level you would need prior to purchase to get the most bang for your buck!<br /><br />For a price point of $12 this is a solid value for such an elite name brand.

"Finally.. a small coin, tobacco, catch all pouch that actually has a masculine vibe bc, it’s made for men!!! I’m always needing an extra compartment or pocket for my 17yr old son.. a place for money, earphones, I.D. - things that seem to get lost without pockets and this is a great solution!! It can attach directly to a 1” width belt or, by using the carabiner and clipping onto any backpack etc..<br /><br />This type of solution is made to be both, small and convenient so, obviously dollar bills must be folded in 1/2 but, it works easy enough- and the main zipper does open approx. the top half of circle so, you can get things in/out- even those coins that would normally end up in the car cup holder or washer machine!!  This is just big enough to fit a debit card/ID inside and zip closed- to give you size reference to an actual item. TBH, the front zipper pocket is small!! We use it to hold much smaller items like- ibprofen for after practices.. it’s perfect and 100% convenient when you need it!!<br /><br />A solid 3pk option- made in 3 different masculine colors which sport a military vibe! The $ for 3 feels spot on.. Canvas material used makes these feel durable and lend confidence that it can contain ones items securely. These would be a great impromptu gift if necessary.

"Incredible quality and made of the softest material,  these are legit sweatpants! Nothing synthetic or added to the mix- Believe it or not, these are 100% cotton and that’s not easy to find these days! Solid stitching, straight reinforced seams.. the attention to detail has not been overlooked. Constructed using a mid-weight fabric, these are reminiscent of what one would expect to find in a college bookstore. Best yet, these are sold at a price point of $30- a great price for such quality.. trust me, you won’t be disappointed.<br /><br />We chose XL in gray and the fit was good. Being the 2nd order from this brand, I noticed although these are adult sizes, items seems to be more inline with a “junior adult” physique.. For example, these are perfect for my 17yr. old son who hasn’t quite reached his adult frame. For reference: He is- 6’4”, 182lb, 33x36, active but not overly athletic. One who hasn’t reached his full filled-in build.. he’s a 17yr. old caught between a tween/man body! The sweatpants are stylish with a gradual taper from mid thigh to ankle removing a lot of excess bulk. This gives them a trendy “slim fit” look but, can also be quite beneficial while wearing during sport activity (excess material won’t hinder game/play.)<br /><br />I recommend washing on cold and line drying.. This will eliminate any possible shrinkage with cotton. After 6 washes.. so far, so good- we’ve had zero pilling! Although not extra deep.. the pockets are great for hand placement.. and can fit at least the smaller cell phone (we have 8+) or, car keys/ID. No! These pockets do not zip closed.. the only downfall I see!<br /><br />Overall, a great find and one I’d recommend without hesitation. The quality of material and craftsmanship is spot on and worth the purchase price. Being of such solid quality these boast longevity and the classic 100% cotton look is timeless!

"The search is over and I AM IN LOVE!! For any who’ve been trying for an authentic hoodie- you know, the one made of 100% cotton and not the latest synthetic mixed alternative.. This is it!!<br />Best of all.. sold at a price point of $30- Are you kidding me!!? Reminiscent of what one would find in a college bookstore..This is a soft, slightly worn in (by appearance only) hoodie that has a timeless and classic look about it. This would stir up memories and make a great gift for any alumni without a doubt.. ha! I actually chose a school that I did not attend- just bc, I loved the hoodie so much!! Plus, I think It’s fair to say the California collegiate system is commercialized in such a way.. making it socially acceptable to wear a name that isn’t affiliated to your education per sé.<br /><br />For those who don’t know… **These are women’s sizes!! NOTHING unisex about this- IF, wanting men’s/universal sizing- this brand does offer this same item in male standard fit. This is cut and sized for the female figure and in doing so, it eliminates a lot of excess bulk- creating a far more flattering look. Having to order XL to insure a fit thru the bust line.. the chest/mid section fit but, without any room to spare! (Feels more in line with Jr. Miss vs. women’s size?!) The length fits a bit longer due to my height and waistband hits just past the bum cheek. For reference: I’m 5’2”, 154lb, 38C, 40+ yr. old and carry my trouble spot thru the mid/waist section (thx to my x4 kids and gravity!) Hopefully this can give you solid info to compare with.<br /><br />This is a soft quality mid weight cotton that has been constructed with nice attention to detail.. all seams and stitching are on point..and no loose threads. This can easily be layered up and worn in the colder months or, paired with shorts + flip flops over sunburn shoulders for a summer night.. it’s truly the perfect in-between all season item!<br /><br />I do recommend washing on cold and line drying.. just to be certain shrinkage won’t alter the fit! (Especially in my situation- where I have no room to spare!) Loving this so much, I’ve worn frequently the past few weeks.. and fingers crossed, I have not had issue with pilling. **double knot hoodie string- or clip together prior to wash- these are prone to disappear into the hoodie in the wash.. trust me, after 2nd time- I got smart!<br /><br />Hands-down I’d recommend on every level..  this is a great quality, 100% cotton, total classic hoodie that would be appreciated by any- I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",0.9973,599,31.526315789473685,0.0,2.29919
"Who wouldn’t love some great tunes on their golf cart..?!! As a family who owns a golf cart yet, has never golfed a day in our life - we’ve spent the last decade doing nothing but, fun rides and adventures all around our planned community with our kiddos on this toy. Music would only enhance this- and give us golf cart karaoke?!!<br /><br />Problem is.. this is a one size fits most. But, it didn’t come close to being “most” for us! How.. when we have the same speaker used in the sellers sample photo description- see photo I included..??!! Right from start when trying to attach we had issues.. this has 6 velcro straps coming out of the sides- (picture a big bug with legs!) Zero instructions included and you'd think this would be straightforward..  Trust me, we tried straps forward wrapping around pole and then, backwards just the same- we even went back to description online.. studied the photo and still had no success.<br /><br />Problems we incurred:<br /><br />•Straps are not long enough to wrap around the pole and speaker- and have enough length to close on themself. (this is placing the speaker in same spot as advertised!)<br /><br />•2 of the 3 sets of straps were sewn in backwards- so, if wrapping around the direction they’re attached- The Velcro teeth on x2 straps are on the wrong side. (Equivalent to getting two negative signs together..) hoping this is an error!<br /><br />•From photo description it appears we are missing a middle extra strap? Photo shows x1 in brown strap thru middle but, we don’t have anything of the sort...??<br /><br />•This has no bottom support or “shelf” for added protection.. this could lead speaker slide at the bottom if it were to become a loose. Golf carts bounce around a bit and vibration may cause this to slip. So, bottom support would be helpful if not, necessary to protect the speaker from falling down  and give the user peace of mind.<br /><br />•This is missing a simple but straightforward set of instructions.<br /><br />overall, this may work with a much smaller size speaker- one with hardly any girth.. Even then, it may be hit/miss to get the securely fastened. I’m afraid a smaller speaker may not produce enough sound to be heard over a motorized golf cart and will it stay safe? In leui of listing this “one size fits all/most..” this would be beneficial to list the actual length and dimension of straps so, one can verify speaker sizes that would work! Listed at a price point of $10- this could be a great find.. if, it could be successful. Tbh, It may be safer to invest more solid option to ensure it will fit/function as expected.

"Does not reach highest temperature like some others- however, does have x4 heat settings.. where most others have only 2..!!<br /><br />A few months ago, I ordered x1 for my son who does afterschool snow removal job during Utah winters.. The hand warmer has been so helpful! So, when my daughter in WA who is the womens college soccer coach started playing their season during winter vs. fall.. thx covid!! She found a need for a hand warmer too!!<br /><br />TBH, this does not reach temperatures like some of the others (x1 we have you can’t touch heat w/out turning down, it gets so hot- and that heat is good if putting inside winter parka.. heat can be felt through the pocket!!) Dont get me wrong, this gets warm just not to the same degree! This may work for some- but, i mention so depending on what/where it’s needed you will know what to expect… All of these hand warmers- are not created equal!! So, choose accordingly-<br /><br />As for ease of use and convenience, this gets five stars! Simple to charge and change x4 levels of heat. However, this can also be used as a portable battery boost for a cell phone- That in itself is awesome!! Battery lasted approx. 5hrs. and recharge takes approx. 2-3hr. TBH, we charge night before so, it’s ready to go the next day-<br /><br />As for the size and durability- This fits nicely into palm of hand. It’s too thick to slide into a glove without a specific warmer pocket. The Device itself is built quite durable with a hard outer shell and charging port feels sturdy and stable.<br /><br />Overall, at the price point offered for a seasonal device this is very reasonable. I say that because, this particular unit can be used year round! A warmer in the winter and battery booster in the summer! If purchasing, one will have plenty of ways to get their moneys worth being its a 2 for 1..!!

"Wow..!! You’re looking at a small sized all-inclusive survival kit that really packs a punch! For the sake of not being redundant and listing included items (see photo I used with the list!) This kit albeit tiny in stature, really holds those basic “urgent” items.. just like circus clowns fit in a toy car!! The overall footprint is perfectly small!! No bigger then, a standard 3x5 notecard- Which makes it a great option to easily tuck inside your gear bag, backpack, tackle box, car glovebox, prepper supplies, etc. Best part of all, when added to a bag- this is so light, you won’t even know it’s there! Mission accomplished.<br /><br />Love the container- its reminiscent of an old fashion sardine can but, with a useable lid to keep it securely closed.. Fact- the container itself is a working piece to this kits overall function! Giving a lot of thought into keeping this minimal. Of course, being this small in size- you should expect this is just for emergent necessities. This couldn’t sustain a person more than a crisis and certainly wouldn’t suffice for multiple people needs. Items included come in increments of x1 (bandaids = x5) So, if traveling in a group for more then a day.. I’d suggest a larger kit or, at the very least supplement this one.. This has the ability to get you out of a tight spot and would say that’s it’s intended purpose!<br /><br />Note: One thing I’d definitely recommend with this kit.. and can’t stress enough- is including a simple how too handbook or, guide sheet to take with Ha! Starting a fire with flint isn’t like flicking a switch! If emergent scenario.. it’s safe to assume, the situation is not ideal! So, if ever found in position to use.. it makes sense to have that helpful 411. It may be difference of life/death. (Wow.. I sounded like Dirty Harry just then- ha ha..!!)<br /><br />If you are prepping for serious situations that could present in your circumstances.. One must also acquire a full first aid kit, food/water supply, Shelter- to subsidize an item like this. BUT, hopefully that is  common sense if you’re truly thinking through being prepared!<br /><br />A few simple adds to make this more complete:  Safety pin, small bic lighter (bc, I saw in a post- fire is harder to start then, one might guess- oh, wait.. that was me!) I clipped onto this case a carabiner with a built-in flashlight!! Just those few little items can beef this up a bit. (would have loved to see them included with the set.)<br /><br />Overall, this is made to avoid being caught empty-handed and could definitely step up to that task 100%. At this price point- this is a great gift for those who love to venture out into situations where they may find themselves needing to be prepared- this will do just that!!

"Loving this water bottle SOO much! And so is everyone else in my family making it hard to get hands on to use! Now, that isn’t an issue with the bottle.. just an obnoxious situation with my kiddos and the fact, they always want my awesome things!!<br /><br />Veefine water bottle is great- it has all the perks that matter:<br /><br />-Size is perfect. We ordered 32oz. and the base is proportionally designed to fit in most standard drink holders.<br /><br />-Love the flip top lid for easy drinking.. it can be done using x1 hand. This also has a carry handle which is x1 of my favorite features.. making grab and go or, clip on to a backpack- easy!!! We’ve had zero issues with the bottle leaking as, the lid has a nice firm thread about it. Even tipping while it’s Clipped to a backpack by the lid. Has zero leaks.<br /><br />-Lid opening is “standard” to other water bottle tops.. we found most standard sized could be used with this bottle, making it interchangeable with the big name lids.<br /><br />-TBH, I don’t use for warm drinks.. only cold. This goes to school in leui of using drinking fountain with the pandemic. If, it’s hooked on the backpack accidentally overnite- there is ice in bottle the next day- so, it keeps ice at least 24hrs! That’s endorsement enough for me..!!<br /><br />-indented lines.. they're not just decor on the bottle! These help you get a good hold or, grasp on the bottle. Perfect ridges for the hand. Ha.. and they look cool!<br /><br />Only con.. x1-2 we’ve had the bottle create a bit of cup sweat! Yes, weather was warmer and not a dealbreaker but, I mention to be transparent.<br /><br />At price point of approx $20 for 32oz. size this is easy to recommend. Everything about the bottle performs on task! I hope this info. can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",0.9941,450,20.454545454545453,0.1,2.32823
"A winner if there ever was one… This is totally iconic Adidas, in providing a complete classic style- we all know and love!! This doesn’t try to add some unique twist nor, want to reinvent the wheel.. This is just a sleek, straightforward, 100% purely classic style beanie! Something so many people have come to expect and appreciate!!<br /><br />Material used is soft and does not create the dreaded “hat head” itch when worn- and I'm talking, even when worn all day! My 17yr old opts to wear a beanie in leui of when most would adorn the baseball hat- Yes! 24/7 -365 days of the year! (365 even includes summer!! Which btw, drives his dad crazy!!) I’d like to say it’s a hip trendy phase- but, we’re coming up on 3+ years of this now- and still going strong! And mind you.. My son is the type to complain about a pea under his mattress…(you know that type…the youngest with a golden child attitude?!) **IF this made him too hot, itchy, uncomfortable or, not stylish.. it would be a no go and yet, he religiously wears this. That is the best endorsement if there ever was one!!<br /><br />So, this may make you wonder- can this breathable hat actually keep you warm? Yes sir!! Made from acrylic, this will help keep anyone’s head retaining heat, and warm- even in the cold Utah winters! Keep in mind: This isn’t made with heavy wool or, with a fleece liner.. So, it’s not best for sub zero extreme temps/water proof needing situations.. that would be winter gear!!<br />One can expect a day to day option with great style and solid, adequate warmth from this beanie! But, the everyday wear ability is different from winter Snow gear!<br /><br />This is a perfect blend of elastin which is used to maintain the shape of the beanie itself.. And to help keep the hat on top of the head! Surprisingly, this has ample stretch and can fit the largest of heads- Yet take note, this isn’t the slouchy style trend.. NO!! This is the classic “night watch cap” by definition -Best part of all, it is a beanie that can mold to the head and as we all know, not all head shapes are created equal- but, with this hats ability to shape shift.. it really can be a “one-size-fits-all!“ And then, with a run thru the machine wash/dry cycle as needed.. it can fall back into shape- like magic! (Note: as with any beanie.. avoid heat drying if, concern for shrinking. I tend to avoid this at first and use dryer when beanie becomes worn in and seems to become too  loose- boom! Doing this, Beanie will be back in action..!!) **Also, with the folded edge this is adjustable! One can adjust hat size by less/more of the fold- A total bonus in getting the right fit!<br /><br />As you can see I’m a total fan and true believer Adidas makes the best beanie by far 100%- at a slightly higher price point it is worth it.. As, this will last you seasons to come! With a child who wears a beanie as often as he wears underwear, I’ve tried every version on the market and hands-down this is our “go to” every time! I hope this info helps your decision… Feel free to let me know!",0.998,721,24.03333333333333,0.1,2.3293999999999997
"This is about the coolest gift one could ever give or, receive..!! It has that total awesome factor for the recipient (bc, it is such a clever item..) But- it will also be the greatest gift given at the party- trust me, this will be the highlight, hands down all around- people will praise you!! It’s definitely one of those items no one thinks to purchase for themselves.. few have ever even seen and all would seriously think it’s was greatest item to have!!! And yes- it will also prove a useful item as well..<br /><br />This is the sickest cooler sleeve which loads up to 6 of your choice canned beverages from the top and it does so, shotgun style.. Ha! (Think of a barrel of a gun, and one can on top of the next..) But, then.. it gets sicker!! This is worn slung over the shoulder like a “6-string!” Yep! slung over the shoulder like Jon Bon Jovi’s guitar on his back..!!! It is a true rockstar sort of feeling-<br /><br />The actual tube/barrel is well insulated with a soft sided PEVA rated interior (think inside of insulated lunch box..) and the exterior feels a bit like canvas- giving it strength/integrity to protect the overall carrier. This keeps cans cold for your drinking pleasure toward the better part of 4hrs. Best part of all- when you are ready to extract a can.. this has a trap door with an easy release… allowing one beverage to come out at a time (Think old school Pez machine as ones removed.. the next item takes its place!)  and remaining cans slide down the barrel “shot gun” style!! See, are you getting the idea of how cool this gift is?<br /><br />Best part of all this has an adjustable shoulder strap and can be fitted for adults or, an older child as well.. I find carrying 6 cold drinks in this fashion.. easier then, lugging around a small cooler- It’s NOT cumbersome like a cooler is and there is no extra weight to the carrier itself. If a person can carry a six pack of soda… (Yes, or beer!) they can carry this just fine! The distribution of weight is such a novel concept- this just works on every level.<br /><br />This makes a great 21st birthday, graduation, bachelor/ette, retirement, beach party gift.. truly, any place one can appreciate BYOB or, just cold drinks on hand- this will be a total hit!! Trust me, at a price point of under $20- it is the perfect gift. I hope this info can help your decision… Feel free to let me know!",0.9995,550,30.55555555555556,0.1,2.32985
"This is a Great looking water bottle in every aspect- complete with your own tiny dancer! Whaaa...?! Men take note: this has the imprinted logo of a ballerina in a tutu smack dab on the front- I only mention this bc, having bought this for my 17yr. old to take to high school.. he was having none of it! (I guess at his awkward impressionable phase- this was just to big a risk of social suicide for him.. wow, high school hasn’t changed much!)<br /><br />As for material: Comparing this next to a Hydro flask in appearance it goes toe-to-toe both, in look and style. I’m using Hydro as the measuring stick only because, it’s what all water bottles apparently aspire to be! Personally, in our house- we find water bottles can be left behind far too easy.. or, dropped/dented (compromising their thermal  abilities..) so, I prefer to be smart and look for good quality at half the $- at least for The chaotic events where these vanish!!<br />Loving the fact this has a wide mouth. For any who aren’t certain why this matters… it’s the ability to put ice into the bottle without chiseling a cube piece by piece to fit in a small opening! This widemouth has 2 straws and one pop straw lid. Straw allows you to drink with the bottle held in place- *lid works without straw attachment… You just need to tip the bottle, this is mostly how we use! As for cleaning of straws- this comes with its own bristle brush and I included a photo the brush actually has varied direction of bristles- helping to clean out where you Cant reach and that’s a perk!! Hack: put x1 tiny drop of dish soap into straw, and scrub with brush.. then, run hot water from faucet thru straw opening for a good minute. This gets all soap remnants out and keeps next use from tasting totally soap tasty- I feel that’s always a good thing!<br /><br />The lid is easy to fasten and secure. I kept this upside down x1hr. just to test for leakage- and I got none! I LOVE The handle on the lid itself.. A total bonus and 100% you will see, use and be happily surprised It’s there! Note: although I cannot personally try it… A lot of varied lids fit between different water bottles.. so, that is certainly worth a try if, wanting to trade around lids (our wide mouth hydro was our bottle just recently lost.. and what I’m replacing.. so, I cannot try swapping that lead specifically to say for sure. But, just don’t rule it out!)<br /><br />As for cold drinks… This is what we use ours for and it keeps things perfectly cold. We filled with 3/4 ice and water- then, checking 24 hours later… We still had ice!! As far as water bottles go I have confidence this will perform as one hopes it would, tiny dancer in a tutu and all!<br /><br />2 other things FYI’s I want to share:<br /><br />1. You can actually by water bottle ice trays- they look like a shape/size of a roll of coins and when frozen, they pop out and slide into water bottle with ease..This is a new discovery for us and as avid h2o bottle users- for a few $, it was a great investment. Pop a few into bottle and you’re good to go- super easy!! (you just have to remember to fill the ice tray each night!)<br /><br />2. If using with any sugary or, flavored substance.. one should empty and rinse out bottle once done. Do not let it sit dirty in sink for a day or 2.. I’ve been told it compromises the integrity and taints the inside of the bottle- ever messing up the flavor moving forward. I also heard never to use with alcohol but… Haven't used in that realm- so, i’m sure if flavor won’t dissipate afterwards?<br /><br />I hope this info can help in your decision… Feel free to let me know!",0.9974,851,28.366666666666667,0.1,1.9292200000000002
"Ordered these for my son who’s struggled through quarantine to get an appropriate work out.. I know, I know- we’re all singing the same sad quarantine song (some in better tune than others-ha-ah!) This was an all inclusive workout set sold at a decent price point and although we had high hopes it would be as great as our gym membership.. (yeah, right!! We all need realistic expectations ..) this had its perks and drawback- ultimately, I would have liked to rate it 3.5 star. I would suggest this is set mean for beginners/novice level exercise enthusiast.. and could meet those needs fairly well. (Used 2-3x week and for 15-30min. at a time..) However, this might fall short for those expecting a little more from their equipment..<br /><br />If purchasing keep in mind:<br /><br />-The grip handles are smaller than some adult male hands..(at least in our house!) Obviously, this could prove problematic if.. ones grip is compromised right from the start. However, an adult females hand seems to fit the grip without issue.<br /><br />-As with any elastic band the stretch is tighter when you begin. This set offers varied resistance (clearly marked by color) after x30 day use.. Lower resistance bands are showing more signs of “slack.” (Nothing has snapped on us! But, the lesser band is much easier to pull.. and I would beg to differ it’s because we’re getting so much stronger!!) Higher levels still have plenty of resistance but, we haven’t used nearly as much so, they stretch out - just something to keep in mind.<br /><br />-Protect door jam with extra padding!! As these are braced against “wood” with a soft rounded ball, we have found- not all door jams are created equal (i’m pretty sure our door jams are made of wood composite?!!) So, be careful and add a small cut out of foam, washcloth or dish towel.. Anything you can easily rig to buffer The wall and protect it- bc, we noticed small indents being left on the door jam itself- not what we wanted and overtime without protection… It’ll only get worse!<br /><br />-Appreciate the bag this came with to store all the items in along with the extra straps/gadgets. This does have instructions- however, they’re a bit tricky to read- just know you can Google a “how to video“ and obtain the info. easily enough . Would have loved to see this set contain added buffer pad for walls.. even a few photos with instructions- possibly something included in the future? I’d also appreciate including a magic eraser for the walls! The black rubber can leave small markings… Yes! These easily come off with wall eraser- Hence, the perk of including one in the bag!<br /><br />Overall, this is not a bad set up. It can give a person- a good resistance workout.. It just has a few idiosyncrasies to work around.. I suggest knowing your audience and their physical size and ability… If, you do prior to any ordering- and are sure to protect the physical structure of the door when setting up- then, one should get what you need from this workout set.<br /><br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",0.9975,683,28.45833333333333,0.1,1.5292500000000002
"Arrived on time and as expected… Love the creature comforts, things like 2 way zipper, extra length and packing bag were fabulous… keep in mind, for this price you’re getting a pretty solid sleeping bag however, isn’t the most padded- A sleeping mat or blowup camp mattress would take this to a much comfier night sleep.<br />No excess weight is associated with this bag! So, for those doing “real deal camping“ you’ve got the ease and hassle free way traveling!<br />This is definitely made for warmer weather not that we camped in the mountains in Utah in July- The days are blazing hot but the nights get cool.. so, be prepared for extra layers or heat source depending on your destination!<br />Overall, for the price you cannot go wrong… We tend to make it outdoors camping.. a few times during summer break! So, for our needs it did just fine!! A more experienced camper May need something more substantial… I would definitely categorize this as, “a sleeping bag for beginner- novice level!” There’s no shame in that.. in fact, I ended up buying 3..<br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",0.9882,246,61.5,0.0,1.89646
"Looking for an @ home workout during covid19..?! Stop here! This is a great set that is user friendly, decently priced, easy to store and travel with (once that is possible again!) And let me tell you- it offers plenty of intense exercise that all can be done with an exercise band. Ohh, and this does so with each level kicking the intensity up a notch. Ulala.<br /><br />These bands are made of a durable quality and provide BOTH, the stretch and resistance- without both, you won’t get what’s truly needed. These are a perfect in width and have been ergonomically designed so, they won’t roll down when in use. Trust me on this one.. I had a diff. set in a “pretty pastel“ of the same style band- only wider and had big issues with those rolling. These are cut thinner and also, have a smooth finish so no pulling the skin- a total added perk!<br /><br /> This uses a “step up“ level that is conducive to this type of workout equipment. These have plenty of defined levels- clearly marked from easy to extreme! And you will definitely see (feel!!) the diff. in between levels- TBH, I’m getting a solid workout at level 3... I can barely pull off- 3 sets/10 reps with the 4th- So much so, I haven’t even attempted band 5! But, this is a good thing! As my workout and strengthening continues, I’ll have the next level waiting to keeping improving my workout!!<br /><br />These bands are clearly marked and as mentioned, they step up level of intensity with each colored band- I appreciate the ability to use different bands for different muscles/exercises. Hack: look online- you can easily find videos and step-by-step examples or, instruction for varied exercise options.<br />I realize these are photographed being used on butt, hip, thighs.. however, you can find plenty of options for varied muscle groups.<br />**Hack: To clean, I use a- yoga mat antibacterial spray or, a wet wipe to clean off. Wait until dry, before putting away..(I store in bag they provide!)<br /><br />Hope this info helps... Feel free to let me know!",0.9956,468,21.272727272727277,0.0,2.29868
"I liked this set of exercise bands. I appreciate the carry bag they come with but, I do wish it was a bit more accessible (easy to get into) and sturdy. Why can’t they make these just a tad bit bigger- why is the struggle always needed to get the item back in its case?!!<br /><br />I also loved the “cheat sheet” card insert as well,  *reference a closer picture included above. This shows drawings of a few exercise options to help you get started and from there.. you can branch out or, tweak use to best suite your personal workout. **you can google 100’s of workouts using bands and also.. get helpful tips and information that way as well. The cheatsheet will also remind a user which band is what strength/resistance. These are color-coded and marked… However, overtime marking looks too fade and with colors being so similar, it may be harder to keep specifically identified. The card will help! ** FYI- these do increase in resistance in the same order as color scheme (they increase light to dark... just FYI! Adds the best helpful feature for identifying.)<br /><br />I’ve used these daily for about two weeks and they seem to hold elasticity quite well- of course, they get more stretchable like any rubber band mentality.. but, still offer plenty of the resistance needed. So far so good, I haven’t had any of them snap/break and this was my biggest concern!<br /><br />I do recommend using over clothing material vs. bare skin- these can pull at any hair on skin (downy or, otherwise!) and it can hurt!! Certain stretches don’t involve skin contact.. and those are by my favorite by far!!<br />I haven’t used the small mat that set comes with- and Im not sure I would - it feels like it’s made of  “papery plastic”..I’m going to stick to the yoga mat I already have!!<br />I’m not 100% certain they’re is a noticeably large difference between the levels of the middle bands.. But, there definitely is between the first and last amount of resistance in the band.<br />Overall, this is a nice set of exercise bands that has held up and done it’s job without any complaints and at a decent price point.<br />I hope this info helps… feel free to let me know!",0.9984,502,27.88888888888889,0.0,1.89952
"This mat is nice quality for the price.. it would be great for any beginner for sure! The length is where  you need to be sure you get the right/good fit- and this mat is 6 feet long. This may seem plenty big, especially for someone like me as, I’m 5’1”..!! However, keep in mind… Is the movement and stretches you’ll be doing while on your mat! And  for those much taller then, my 5ft self- this may pose a bit of a problem by not providing enough length..<br />•Best way to avoid getting a mat that is too short-<br />is to raise arms to a relaxed stance above head.. then, add that measurement to your total height- (from top if head to end of palms- add on these inches- not entire arms length!!) this will insure you’ll fit on your mat during all sun salutations and downward dogs! Makes sense.. But, something I hadn’t realized when ordering. Even so, @ 5ft. tall and reach of my arm still left me approx 4+” to spare- But, something to definitely be aware of when selecting!<br />•Strap is easy to put on and is all one piece-<br />Assemble in elastic material and has reinforced stitching to avoid breaking. **dont throw it away!! The strap was loose in bottom of box- and if you don’t look thoroughly, it could easily make it out to the trash- mine did!! But, once I realize it was missing I retraced my steps and found it on the bottom of the tubed boxed! Just pat attn.- this IS NOT placed on mat when it arrives!!! **Bonus: I LOVE the length of the strap.. not too long to bounce around your knees and get in the way when carried- This strap offers just enough slack to carry of the shoulder perfectly- I attached photos.. and this is perfect length!!! (length is NOT adjustable!)<br /><br />•Not all mats are created equal! BUT.. A thinner mat is not always a bad thing. I did order one with extra thickness before.. tbh, it’s very “grabby” on the feet.. This is thinner so, yes! You may feel pressure points on the floor a bit more however, this mat allows for easy movement with the feet- I loved the textured surface- it helps keeps feet from becoming sweaty and slipping!<br />• I have used the mat a handful of times.. and maybe OCD about disinfecting after every use, I don’t care! I use a misting mat cleaner that is all natural.. I spray both sides with a light coat. So far, we’ve held up just fine! No sticky or, peeling of the mat itself- **the key here people: to let cleaner dry before rolling/storing your mat!!! Here’s a Life hack: whenever you clean your mat, always be sure it’s 100% dry before rolling/storing! You will thank me for this and mats life expectancy will last much longer than you think! Not too mention, you won’t be the one who’s mat stinks up the room for the whole class.. that’s always a good thing!!<br />Overall, this is a great mat and good investment for any who need a clean, nice, decent space to do their exercises- it may not have all the added extras but, for many... those are just that, extra!<br />I can recommend this feeling confident it can do it’s job and one will get their moneys worth.<br />I hope this info helps.. feel free to let me know!",0.999,742,25.58620689655172,0.3,1.9897000000000002
"What a perfect purchase… And big surprise when it arrived!! I was expecting a yoga mat like those I’ve purchased in years past- but, ohh no!!<br /><br />Being a novice at this whole yoga thing.. I’ve only bought 2 previous.. (and x1 if those, I lost!) honest, i felt they covered my needs just fine. Wow! Little did I know.. that’s about all they did- “cover“ the floor!! I was unaware that these were made to provide more then, a perimeter to do your “downward dog” (truly, I used to think.. a mat was for keeping you off dirty floor and claiming real estate, nothing more!!)<br /><br />This mat not only provides comfort for anyone with that “sore spot” when pressed into the ground. For myself, it helps the knees so much- And actually allows me to participate in certain positions I couldn’t before- total bonus! Padding is so comfortable yet, doesn’t grab at your feet during movement… allowing for easy transitions. I can use this mat without yoga socks and feel as if, I still have solid footing which is helpful when balance is concerned!<br /><br />The material used does not create an excess of sweat as one might assume when in contact with skin… more impressive, this wipes off with cleaner so nicely- I haven’t had an issue with that gym bag smell! In fact, I accidentally left this in the car over the holiday weekend… And was shocked not to be “hot boxing” sweat x3 days later (that was sitting in 80° weather mind you!!) not sure if that’s an extra kudos to the mat.. or, the cleaner?!! (I’m guessing its the mats magic powers since, this cleaner smell dissipates once it is dry...<br />LOVE the rich teal color- it’s 100% unisex and no Physics degree needed to use the carry shoulder strap that’s included.. BoOm! Mic. drop- goodnite Salt Lake City!!<br />If in the market- here’s a one stop shop that encompasses all components to make you happy! Sold at a price that matches the caliber of product. Sure, you might find a cheaper version.. but, remember.. it will definitely perform like it too!!<br /><br />I hope this info. helps.. feel free to let me know!",0.9981,500,23.80952380952381,0.0,2.29943
"The idea is there and in theory.. these Snapatite little gems can do the trick and be that all inclusive utensil you’re looking for.. A few things to help you make an informed decision:<br /><br />•The perk of a 3 in 1 is nice- doesn’t get much easier than that! However, the type of food eaten will effect the efficiency of these utensils.. *note: they are far from norm. of daily use but, expected.. the knife is to cut/separate simple things vs. using dirty hands! Fork has stable prongs to pick things up with ease. Spoon does the trick as well- but, is a tad smaller in size..<br />•Color coding is sublime.. especially, if you have kids, these things matter! Assign each person a color- Then, it’s their job to wash, pack, keep track of, and/or- store as expected.<br />•washing with soap/water will work fine on plastic. Just be sure to rinse/clean INSIDE the knife sheath too!! If using knife while eating and restoring to one unit, this can get food yuck inside- so, inspect all pieces before thinking this is clean and packing away.<br />•Keep in mind- overall size Is still smaller then, Standard utensil.. Even with both sides connected. May be a total bonus if, space is an issue- but, may be harder to use for some larger adults.<br />• These do not come with any type of personal cover or, storage bag. For germ safety/keeping clean, this would be great if included. But, one must provide protective cover on their own.<br />•safety/peace of mind- this can be used for all ages without worry of injury. Love the knife is covered to prevent accidental piercing of pack/person while storing.<br /><br />I ordered to place inside emergency “bug out” kit for me/my fam.. with hope I’ll never need to use for this purpose. Yet, with things as crazy as they are in the ‘corona world’ right now.. We must be ready for anything. I’ve got kiddos who will look to me to fix things if, they go downhill quick!! So, for my purpose- I’m happy with the product! If things settle back down, I’ll take the pack camping and have everything all ready to go.. For our needs this worked great and has the ability to do the same for you as well!<br />I hope this info helps.. feel free to let me know!",0.9977,505,29.705882352941178,0.0,1.89931
"Being terrified to try this.. I made sure to spray it away from myself and wind- BuT, I DID IT!! This took slightly more pressure then I had expected!  Seems like a good feature to have.. to help avoid an accidental spray. I figured IF, one ever finds themselves in circumstances where this needs to be dispensed..  It only makes sense “fight or flight” endorphins will kick in, making the ability to push/dispense this, second nature.!!! Yet, this seeming to require a tad more effort to ‘push’ will help an accidental discharge!<br /><br />This is also protected with slide/cover mechanism to keep from an accidental discharge. BUT, big picture.. I feel you can’t be too careful and it helps to have ALL efforts in play to avoid unwanted  discharge. (especially if this made it to the hands of little ones without noticing!! This goes w/o saying- but, it must be handled with same care as a poison would be kept safe around children.)<br /><br />I love the split ring and ability to hook onto keyring or lanyard. It also has a ‘quick release’ that when decompressed, detaches off the ring.. then, reclips when done. For the record- I did another test but, truly don't recommend you do. TBH- I did this just to see if I could.. And with one rough tug, I could pull apart the ‘quick release’ w/out decompressing the button. *note: Doing so broke the plastic “quick release” and I’m ok with that- I just wanted to be certain.. IF needed, it could be yanked off within 1/10 of a split seconds time.. yep! it could!! Best way to not worry about retrieval in an urgent need...?? Be prepared!! before any vulnerable situation- (ie, parking lot alone, jogging etc.) put dispenser in hand PRIOR to walking out the door!! A bit excessive, sure! But, if needed.. it may save your life!!<br /><br />I actually have given these as graduation gifts to many of my daughter friends.. we live in a rural community in Utah where a door can stay unlocked and keys can stay in cars.. many are not prepared  for realities of big cities and dangers that go along with them.. Even traveling abroad, it’s better to be safe than sorry. For the record, I give this with the high decibel keychain alarm.. either can be a huge deterrent!! My daughter is a Rover employee and walks dogs pre/post dawn hours.. I make her take this on dog walks. She has also been placed in charge of dogs x2 her size.. if ever a situation occurred and dogs got into a fight, she must have a way to render an upper hand- no! Never needed this but, has it on a lanyard for safety! (She felt this was easier then the suggested dog taser!)<br /><br />I feel this is a quality defense Mechanism that can be priceless for any persons placed in a vulnerable situations- safety first!! It offers a peace of mind and as a parent.. I feel better knowing both of my girls in college keep this on them and know how to use it- just in case! I recommend to any who may be in similar situation-",0.998,664,18.444444444444443,0.0,2.2994

This provides the details for a good investment and peace of mind.. so much more then, rubber elastic bands that are cheaper.. and have the ability to snap!!! If it’s happened to you- then, you can vouch for how much this can hurt, while leaving a welt the size of Texas. Oh, and worse yet.. scare you half to death!! All leaving you in the end without the workout tool- ugh! This band is over 2” thick and made of material.. assuring there won’t be a “snap snafu” with you as the target!<br /><br />This has a small/simple travel cinch bag to store this in and keep it confined/easy to pack.. This fits in the tiniest of pockets, and takes up no room at all- She’s kept band clean by using an equipment spray (made by adidas) and wiping it down with antibacterial wipes.. So far, this hasn’t retained any nasty locker room smell and her cleaning regimen should keep it that way! I think one could also hand wash w/ mild soap and hang dry with no issues..<br /><br />This is part of a 3 band series.. and the size of the band (length) Controls the intensity workout. If purchasing a single band, be certain to get the best fit for your workout routine and examples are described on their website very clearly.. yes, you prefer to vary the band resistance- I would suggest ordering the 3 pack as, the $ spent is a great deal saved vs. ordering individually.",0.9818,427,35.583333333333336,0.0,2.29454
"Wow- I got this in smaller size black..And if I just converted the math, I would’ve known… It was going to be really small! When I think liters- for some reason I think big, my bad!! I was hoping to store beach towel and small items.. not in this bag! Now, I know- I need to order those in much larger size (Prob. 30liter would suffice my need..)<br /><br />For those who are looking for a waterproof bag to take to pool or beach, this is really nice. Just keep in mind, the smaller size can fit a cell phone and man-size wallet (or, coin style wallet) and car keys. All good things to keep dry, just not everything!! The bonus, this will help keep your vital items together- (when we go to leave the beach.. seems we never can locate the car keys at departure and spend time in a hot, cranky, wet mode retracing our steps?! This will eliminate that problem for sure.) Let’s face it- cell phones/electronic key/fobs/<br />Etc. all cant get sandy or, wet and still function properly.. so, good to keep encolsed!<br /><br />Style of bag is simple in theory- Picture of brown paper bag (lunch bag style) you fill with goods and then, roll down the top! Well, This functions with same concept… Only, once rolled down – there is a strong clip To hold it in place, keeping water from getting in at all. The only struggle I had was the plastic was very stiff and just a bit harder to roll- i’m guessing this will be easier if, overall size of the bag was bigger?!<br />Material used for strong and durable. It gives you no worry that water can enter- definitely quality.",0.9843,369,24.6,0.0,1.8952900000000001
"Love the bright color and all the details in this rucksack.. it’s Made of a great material and feels strong but, not heavy. the stitching is done nice<br />and reinforced in all the right places- it gives you the confidence you want with a pack when you’re out on the go!!<br />This has many creature features to hold various items- smaller pockets (which I just love!!) these pockets are great for electronics or, sunscreen and chapstick- car keys.. everything seems to have its place, this has bottle holder and best of all- while offering all these nice extras.. it folds up really quite small. This would be fantastic to take on vacation… Use on a day hike, trip to Disneyland or a day at the beach! The water resistant material is great for rain or pool days...<br /><br />The only angst I had was trying to figure out the straps that buckled to keep this in place. There were quite a few of them which is nice only if you need to hold thing tight and in place.. But, maybe a bit too many- if just using for casual day!? With the straps not in use- you have a lot of extra hanging streamers to go along with you..<br />This was a higher price point than some I found online that look similar. However, I am assuming that is due to the strength and quality. You get what you pay for and this rucksack seems to appear strong enough to hold up to a rough day of use.

Even on it's least sensitive setting, it still adds 1/4 more distance then what I actually traveled. Oddly though, it measures steps correctly when walking on carpeting or on an elliptical. At the track and on cement, plan on shaving off 1/4 of your distance to be semi accurate.<br />If you want to be encouraged by an overzealous pedometer, go for it.

Alas, it is short that you have to use the other arm as your anchor, not easy!.  good for strengthening the outter leg muscles [place band around both ankles].

"My little kids were excited to have their very own trampoline. This trampoline was appropriately sized for my very small toddler (25 lbs.). But my 40 lb. six-year-old was far too big. The net around the trampoline came just below his shoulder. It also had a tendency to tip over. We had to clear the ground under it very well because the smallest stick or bump on the dirt would make it tip. After two weeks, my toddler falling into one of the posts made the post break off, leaving a jagged metal spot where it stood. There was no way to just take the net off the trampoline and keep using it because the posts that hold the net posts in place stick up about 6 inches around the edge of the trampoline, leaving metal posts around to fall on.

I've had other booty bands and they don't mark the strength of the band on the band. So annoying to have to stretch all three before figuring out which one is the medium.

The drawstring is white nylon, which would be fine if it were an internal drawstring. But being on the outside, it should have matched the pants a little better.",0.8829,106,13.25,0.1,1.89487

I prefer the half gallon size to the full gallon size. It is just easier to carry around. The motivational sayings on this one count down the day on the half gallon.

My only complaint is that I don't know the color coding, so I'm grabbing a random color and trying it and then swapping it out for another. The bag makes it super easy to store.

The frame holds the pack away from your back, so there is also ventilation behind your back and it keeps the pack a little off of you. There is a thin waist strap and chest strap. Both are on the thin side, but this pack isn’t going to be heavy enough to need to to be thicker.<br />This is not a long trip pack unless you happen to be an exceptionally light packer.

"This is a very interesting bag. It can be a fully functional hiking style backpack. Or, you can cover the backpack straps and use it as a carry on duffle bag type bag. There are plenty of pockets for a variety of items. The main pocket area is very suitcase style. The front pocket is padded for carrying a laptop or tablet . The back of the main pocket area is also padded, so you don't have sharp bits of things poking into your back when using it as a backpack. There is a detachable strap to use for carrying this bag over your shoulder, like a duffle bag. It comes off completely. It is very versatile. There are also multiple adjustments in the backpack straps so you can get them really comfortable to carry for long periods of time. There are no side pockets. Two front mesh pockets could be used for carrying water bottles, but they aren't quite elastic enough for me to fully trust them,. Very versatile, well made bag.",0.9081,194,13.857142857142858,2.2,2.93243
"The adjustable belt is really weird. It isn't stretchy. It is just regular webbing with a hook at one end. The hook doesn't stay if you don't have the belt tight. And the belt isn't all that comfortable. I bought this for a kid, so the fit isn't that great for him.<br />The canteen is plastic, but it is pretty large. The cap screws off and on. The cap saver piece comes off when you unscrew it, so it is pretty pointless. The mechanism that holds the canteen onto the belt is really weird. Everything is metal hooks on this thing. They don't stay well and they aren't very comfortable or convenient. You really just have to take the canteen out of the pouch to drink from it, since getting to hooks on and off is a little bit of an ordeal. Unless you set it down, then it'll just fall off when you don't want it to.<br />For the price, I'm not too upset about it. But I imagine I'll have to make a paracord &#34;necklace&#34; holder for this before long because the belt and the hooks and all are pretty annoying to work with. I think we'll stick to the circular metal canteens with the neck strap next time.",0.1266,260,17.333333333333332,1.4,1.65798
"I love the size of this water bottle. It holds 24 oz. It requires hand washing, but that is usual for water bottles in my experience. And clearly, since it is metal, you can't microwave it. Now, the lid is really not ideal. It is no spill. But not like kid snippy cups. This has a button that you have to press while you drink to open the spout. It also has a spout cover, in addition the the button mechanism. It can be hard to get used to that. You can still drink one handed, you just have to pick it up correctly to do so. It also has a loop on the top that you can use to hang it from the stroller or your bag or whatever. The spout itself is pretty short. It just takes some getting used to with the whole press the button to drink thing.",0.5579,173,12.357142857142858,0.0,1.76737

"My 6 year old has ADHD. He cannot sit still, especially when he is doing his school work (on the computer). I put this in his computer chair to see if it helped him stay focused. He likes the bumpy side up. (Extra sensory input, I guess.) He stayed in his seat a larger percentage of the time. (As opposed to stand, sit, sit on knees, squat on the chair, stand again, etc.) He fell out of his chair much less. And he seemed to concentrate better. (Not sure of that will wear off as the newness of the seat wears off.)<br />On the opposite side of things, my 10 year old who doesn't focus well but does not have ADHD did not do well with it.

The black bill is also the athletic mesh material on top with a standard black cotton under the bill. Has a slightly stretchy band inside the hat for a nice fit. The tags are sewn to the band and tucked up under it, no floppy tags hanging around inside the hat. While the front of the hat has some stiff stabilizer to hold the shape, the back is super floppy.

The wider base makes it easier for him to ride and balance than the 2 wheeled versions. And it came in his favorite color, blue.

"I am new to SUP. This board has been perfect for a beginner. It was easy to set up, easy to store, easy to transport, and easy to SUP. The board came with a pump (to inflate and deflate the board), a bag (to transport and store the empty board), an ankle leash, a repair kit, and a bungee (attached to the top front of the board for storage).<br /><br />The board deflated is pretty heavy. The bag that comes with the board is backpack style and makes it easy to carry, even with all my other gear and kids.<br /><br />The pump worked easily and quickly. My pressure valve on my pump did not work, so I just had to guess and hope for the best when inflating.<br /><br />The 3 fins on the board make it easy to stay on a forward path. They do make it a little more difficult to turn, but made it simple to stand and paddle in a straight direction without much practice.<br /><br />I also tried out a hard &#34;beginners&#34; board from a paddle board rental place. The inflatable is so much easier for a beginner. It just moves less side to side in the water and seems more stable. Not to mention being easier to transport to and from the water.<br /><br />The surface of this board is very grippy on your feet. You can ride barefoot or with shoes on without worrying about slipping. The handle is perfectly placed to easily carry it once it is inflated.<br /><br />Overall, a super high quality board. The material is very, very thick. I have zero concerns about it popping. I am very happy with this board and with my adventures into the sport of SUP.",0.995,377,25.133333333333333,0.2,2.3585

So I'm awkwardly trying to use the spoon with my right hand. The pros are that they are in a nice little case, so you can just pop them into your pocket or purse and take with you. They are also stainless steel and therefore easy to clean. Cons are the aforementioned left-handed folding up and missing a keychain clip.

My husband has Gillian Barre Syndrome and OT had him working with these. it helped so much that we had to buy this for home use.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who has finger and hand weakness.

"I was happily surprised by this bag.  It has great length, even for a family with most males going well 6-2 to 6-4.  It is not the softest material but has a little fill in it.  I like that it is not a mummy style so it has  little room to move.  It rolls down to a remarkably small size and compresses so it is good for hiking and paddling. The zipper was amazingly smooth the first three or four times up and down, but then it caught a loose thread and bound.  Once freed it was smooth again, but worried about fraying now.  I did not see any other sign of loose strings and it seems to be well made. for the price, this is a very good sleeping bag.<br /><br />1/23 Now having these bags for a couple of years, I can vouch that they have held up well for a good number of sleepovers and some car camping.  Glad I got them",0.9803,186,18.6,0.0,2.2940899999999997
"I love the sleek look of this bag! That carbon fiber look is great as is the wedge shape.  It attaches easily and well to our son's bike and although it does not hold much, it does hold a few tools and his phone.  It is not the easiest things to get into due to the water proof zipper.  My biggest gripe though it why they chose not to put the straps in the middle of the bag so that it would hang directly below the crossbar rather than off to the side.  That seems like a complete design choice and not an engineering necessity, but it does mar an otherwise super nice product.",0.9503,123,20.5,0.0,2.28509
"These are far from high quality, but they are good enough for day to day use.  They are very light weight and great for when you just need to cut down some wind or mild cold.  I would use them for the same uses that I use Jersey gloves - non severe cold, where you need to have dexterity in your hands.  I feel they run a little small but all in all, they are decent pair of gloves.",0.6652,86,21.5,0.0,1.79956
"The perfect Trio for under $20.  We got a practice basket and a couple of beginner sets and realized that we need a couple more so we can equip a foursome of mostly beginners.  This is a great set, the solid colors are easier to find than the tie dyed sets we got other kids.  They are solid discs and perhaps there is more distance in higher priced discs, the kids are not going to be able to reach those limits for some times.  I threw them and they fly true and well.  So for the price, they are an absolutely solid beginners setup.",0.9565,114,19.0,0.0,2.28695
"This has some more substantial pieces going on which makes it kind of heavy, but also very useful.  I love that there is a useful knife, a useable light and good fire starting equipment.  The first aid supplies are a decent base but needs to be built on a bit.  I replaced the tweezers with a good pair of metal tweezers and augmented the bandages and put in some pain killers, antihistmines, water purifier pills and some other basics.  There is enough room to fill in the missing items.  I also added fishing line and hooks which I was kind of surprised were missing with the attention to other things.<br /><br />The case is pretty solid and all of this can be stored in a car easily or put in a bug out bag or backpack.  But like I said, it is a little heavy so not good for back packing hikes.  It is not optimized for weight.  All in all though, I am very surprised with the quality and equipment that went into this pack.",0.9323,198,22.0,0.0,2.27969
"This is a very interesting product.  First, let me recommend that everyone gets rubberized nets for their landing nets.  It is so much better for the fish in catch and release situations as net knots can really damage fish skin.  This net has fine rubberized netting so it should work well.<br /><br />The folding function is very interesting.  It y's out into a decent sized net and locks in place with an interesting design that is easy to lock and release. It folds down into a very portable and storeable size that makes my other landing nets look like the storage and packing nightmares they are.<br /><br />My only real concern with the net is in overall ruggedness.  It would handle pan fish with no problem, but it's smaller size and slightly flimsy handle would make we worried of anything over five pounds.  Salmon, Catfish, and pike might push it past it's limit, but you could net crappie all day.",0.748,190,23.75,0.0,1.8244
"I got two like this and they made me understand the Hammock movement.  They straps make it very easy to install in the trees and the self contained bag makes it easy to store and transport.  It was extremely comfortable and I felt very safe, especially knowing that it is rated to 500 pounds - well over engineered for one and comfortably capable for two.  It looks good and I'm glad we got it.  Everyone should have one in their camping/outdoor fun supplies.  Highly recommend this one.",0.986,95,15.833333333333334,0.0,2.2958
"We had gotten the kids single hammocks sometime ago and they loved it, but they always seemed a little small to me.  This one fits my 6-4 big boned frame very well and feels rugged enough to keep it up off the ground.  500 pound limit is amazing, pile in a kid or two - or three for that matter! The strap system is quick and easy to install on the trees.  We have used it a little bit in backyard but plan on bringing it camping next summer a lot.  Super comfortable, wish I had one like this years ago.<br /><br />Also, it looks great!",0.9909,123,20.5,0.0,2.29727

Kids love the colors and the carrying bag and while the camping season is getting to the end, these will definitely be going to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area with us a couple times next summer.<br /><br />The construction is decent and the material is good and absorbant.

It is huge and absorbant.  I also love that there are two towels in the set so you have a shower towel and another for other uses.  They both roll up and pack neatly into the nice little travel bag.  It is a bit of a rip off of a more expensive towel we got from REI, and it may be a little bulkier and maybe not quite as nice, but it is probably a lot cheaper and does the job.  Super loved these on the trip and they did well in the washer and dryer when we returned.  Recommend!",0.9718,148,18.5,0.0,2.29154
"I have a similar product from REI and was a little worried about how big a knock off this was going to be, but I have to admit that I'm pretty happy with this.  We got it yesterday and put it into immediate use at the hot tub.  It is absorbant and it did dry over night.  I love that this is actually two two towels of which I would probably only pack the small one camping, but both could come canoeing.  The outer hem is pretty good.  It may not have as good of materials as the one I got from REI, but it is definitely functional and I'm assuming, at a fraction of the price.  The tag is kind of a cheaper immitation of the REI version and the name ""GREEN TREEN"" is a little ridiculous, but the product seems to work well and is decently constructed.  We'll see how it wears during next summers camping season.",0.9805,177,22.125,0.0,2.29415
"I really like this basket.  We used it at on a vacation to entertain the kids and introduce them to disk golf and they really enjoyed being able to make their own challenges.  I have to say that the basket has its advantages and disadvantages but all in all it is great.  They chains are not the best for catching discs and depositing them in the basket and there are better baskets out there, but not with the great portability and easy of transport of this one.  It assembles in seconds and is sturdy enough to handle wind and strikes by discs with no problem.

"I like the look and quality of the but there are a couple of design issues that make them a little less useful than they could.  The biggest issue is that the buckle halves are hard to pass trough belt loops so that it takes a considerable time to thread the belt on and off.  That is a little frustrating.  I love the feel and flex of the belt webbing, and once it is threaded through the loops, I love way the belt buckle works - almost like a seat belt, but it is just too clumsy to put on and off.  Also nice is how customizeable it is in length.  you choose the length. If not for the problems putting it on and taking it off, I would love this belt.",0.982,143,20.428571428571427,0.2,1.5546000000000002
"We got this and have really loved playing it.  In fact we have gotten the neighbors and family into it.  It is probably the most confusing simple game I have ever played, but after a few rounds, it makes perfect sense.  It is a great family game and good mixer for parties or get togethers.

"I am a huge fan of buscuits and gravy and I was super excited when I saw this product come out.  In fact, I picked three up as soon as I saw them and took them on a boundary waters trip.  They are very easy to make, simply open and pour in some hot water.  At times, it is hard to get the water down into the corners of the bag but it creates kind of a biscuit and gravy stew.  It is not quite as aesthetically pleasing as fresh serving, but I found the taste to be pretty authentic and great. It's a little messy to eat, but satisfying.  Well satisfying if you eat the entire bag as an indivual - open air really gets the appetite going and 8 hours of paddling uses a lot of calories.  But all in all, I love this product.",0.9921,162,20.25,0.1,2.3276299999999996
"I have played a little bit of Kubb and was really looking forward to getting a set of my one.  I have played with everything from home made to ""regulation"" or ""Pro"" sets and I have to say that this set has a good feel to it.  The batons have a decent heft to them.  I had thought it was a little light, but recently played with a regulation set and it seems pretty spot on.  The wood has been getting a little dinged and some paint is getting scratched off, but holding up well.<br /><br />But the key is that all the pieces you need come in a nice little package and it all stacks back in (partially thanks to the great idea of putting a packing diagram instruction sheet in the bag.<br /><br />We got this during the Covid-19 lockdown and it has been great being able to go outside and get some fresh air while self isolating.  It is a fun and unique game.  Recommend this set as an entry point for anyone interested in the game, or a obscure new outdoor game to try.  We really like it.<br /><br />Updated: 4/27 We have spread this game to a number of neighbors and family members and they all have really liked it.  It is a great new way to get into the game.  They have said that they included instructions are not great, they made sense to me, but I knew how to play.  I did notice that they don't really say you need to knock over the king at the end so they are a little thin, but I thought they way they walked through a couple of rounds explained it well.  I highly recommend watching a youtube video.  Bumping to 5 stars as it has been so well received.  I think a couple more sets are on order now.",0.9969,362,25.857142857142858,0.0,2.29907
"It took a while to try these as we got them after things started to ice up, but we did mount them up to transport a kayak back from a friends cabin and it worked well.  They fit our rails fine and we were able to cinch in our kayak securely.  Temps were in the thirties and it handled those temps and winds better than we did. All in all a pretty decent set of yokes which will probably end up on our kids car for his solo adventures.",0.979,94,23.5,0.1,1.9237
"These are very thick socks.  Think I need to add a half to whole shoe size to wear these. They are wonderfully cushioned and wonderfully insulating.  I wore these while hiking/birding in Minnesota and did not get cold feet at all, although the temps were in the teens and twenties so not a real Minnesota test.  They look great but I'm a little worried about how they will wear and wash.  The lining is so soft, I'm worried it will pill or condense, but one wash and two wearings and it is looking good.  Because of their thickness I can't see this being a high rotation pair of socks, so it should last years.",0.695,128,18.285714285714285,0.0,2.2085
"I love this design so much.  The pull handle is great for pulling it back out of the bulkhead and the shape is great.  30L is not huge, but it is also easy for stowing and retrieval.  We do a lot of canoeing and kayaking in the BWCA of Minnesota and I can't say how much I am looking forward to portaging with this.  I was so excited when it came, a stuffed it full of jackets and tested it out in both bulkheads of my kayak and it fit both great.  This will almost surely be on my reorder list so we can outfit both kayaks with at least one.  Now we just have to wait for the lakes to thaw...<br /><br />The backpack straps are ok, I would not want to hike with them under weight for long distances, but it is perfect for portaging or going from canoe to camp.  The seams look good and durable and the water tight flap looks good and tight.  Otherwise it is a pretty simple bag, the webbing is nice but questionable that it will be used much. Mostly it is just a beautiful well sized bag with a great pull handle for stowing.  I love it.",0.9968,231,21.0,0.0,2.2990399999999998
"We have been in Crossfit for a while and I have found the rower to be a great workout.  Now our busy lives are keeping us from the gym way too often so when we got a chance to get a reviewer rower we were super stoked.  Assembly was ok, especially when you realize that the bolts are prethreaded and need to be removed from the components to use them.  At first I was surprised that none were in the little bag of bolts I was given.  The basic assembly is actually pretty easy, but take a little deciphering from looking at the illustration and reading the brief instruction text.  With many distractions it took me about 35 minutes.<br /><br />The hardest thing about the assembly was getting the seat to right smoothly.  It has a couple plates that can move up and down and for some reason they are loose and fall onto the top of the rails.  I tightened these away from the rail.  Also, there is a bottom roller that needed to be raised with some bolts on the side that took some tightening to get all the rollers in contact and now it glides very well.<br /><br />As for general use.  I now know how spoiled we are to have such nice rowers at the gym.  This is decent quality, but not on par with the pro gym machines.  The tension at top level is not particularly hard but it does keep the fly wheel from flowing.  The computer is good in general, the battery cover was deformed on the back but just looks bad, it functions fine.  We also have a little issue with the general angle that might just be familiarity, but you sit well above the plane of the handles so it feels like I am pulling up more than usual rather than just back.  I was afraid that there would not be enough pulling distance (i am 6'3"") but there is no issue with that.  We'll use it and see how it goes.",0.9035,384,24.0,0.6,2.05105
"These are very cheap and $5 a piece, but they are also very cheaply made.  I am used to far more substantially manufactured ski masks.

"I was instantly disappointed with these as soon as a grabbed them to pull out of the package.  They are extremely lightly built.  The materials are cheap and minimal.  I am used to goggles being far more substantial.  These don't even have closed foam padding.  I would think they would hold moisture like a sponge.  Ok... After that first impression I remembered what these cost and perhaps they might be worth what you paid for them, but I really wouldn't want to be wearing these.  I do like the eye protection, but they are so flimsy I would not trust them to survive a trip.  Definitely would not consider gifting them.  For me, it is worth paying more for more of a product.",0.7178,139,13.9,0.0,1.0153400000000001

Cap is decent and the seal seems to be strong and I have had no issues with leaking.  I'm not sure why they included a cheap carbiner with the bottle.  I got the 23 ounce and think I should have gone with the 27 to get a little more capacity, but really cannot complain about anything important about this bottle.

It fills with just a few lung fulls of air and can easily be adjusted for hardness with a little more of less air.  The valves work well with two stages so you can open it up fully for deflating or with a valve setting for easier filling and closing, (nice touch.)<br /><br />I was a little worried about the toughness of the pillow, but I have used it for napping and lounging and it seems to be holding up well and keep its air. The material is fairly soft and does not pull hair.  It feels like it will be water resistant and will dry quickly should it get wet.  I have used small camp pillows before but never inflatable pillows like this so it is kind of new, but I think it will work great.

There are warming packet pockets and good coverage up the arm, past the sleeve.  The are flexible and fit a wide range of hand sizes. i.e. mediums fit large hands pretty well.

I like that it works with a single double A and it worked well even with the depleted battery I grabbed for a test trim.  These do tickle a little at best and occasionally yank hair out at worst, but this one just gently tickled and trimmed the hair efficiently and safely.  The little slots that your nose hairs fall into for cutting are long and deep so skin is safe.  It quickly cleared my nose and had much looking much neater in no time.<br /><br />I really like that the cleaning brush is stored right along side the battery rather than being one more think at the bottom of my bathroom drawer.

This one does spark ok and I think you could get a fire going with this eventually under ideal conditions, but I would still keep a small container of dry tinder to get a fire going.

"We used a lot of water bottles in our family.  We do a lot of camping, hiking and canoeing and we filter a lot of water, but for now we mostly trust pumping filters and pump into a clean water bottle, taking care to avoid contamination.  My youngest has used this a couple of times just as a water bottle, filtering tap water through it.  I'm leery to use is as a filtering solution in the wild, but it seems legit.  We will take it to the Boundary Waters Wilderness Area in a few weeks and will decide there whether to trust it, but we will probably just filter into the bottle and use the internal filter as a second line of defense.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'm not huge on straw bottles, but the kids like them.

This one may stay around as it is pretty cool. I love that it is silicon and gets away from plastic, although I don't know that it is particularly more eco friendly in manufacture, but it should have less known bad chemicals.<br /><br />It is pretty amazing how compact it crushes down to and I love that it is dish washer safe.  It does come with a cheap and shaped bottle brush to get into the creases, but hopefully it continues to come out of the wash fine.

"We have been using very similar ""spoons"" in our camp pack for years and we have been happy with how they have held up and how they have worked over the years, but as our family grows, we have had to add more metal silverware to the pack.  These will let us take some out and replace them with these lightweight, multipurpose spoons.<br /><br />These appear to be well made and if our experience with similar items is any indication, we should be able to use these for years to come.  They may not be the best in all situations, but they are workable in all situations from chili to fettechini alfredo or any other camp food we need utensils for.<br /><br />The one very unique thing about these spoons is the system for holding them together or attaching to packs. There is a strap that goes through two holes on the spoons that allow you to tie them together or attach them to a pack.  For use they will be going into a dedicated utensil bag in one of our packs so not necessary, but this option would allow you to attach it to the outside of a jacket or pack.

The volume slider again, works but does not inspire any great feeling of quality.  Which goes for everything on this device.  It will do the job for cheering on our kids at cross country, but thats about it.<br /><br />Truly it fits our needs, but not much more.",0.6664,104,20.8,0.0,1.3999200000000003

"I, like many, would love to get away from plastic water bottles.  This is perhaps a partial solution.  I had a great glass water bottle that I loved, until I dropped it.  Then the advantages of plastic and stainless steel were pretty obvious. In this case, the glass part of the bottle is just a mason jar so It can be replaced if dropped.  But the main reason to get rid of plastic is to get rid of the chemicals that leach into your drink.  Since this is still partially plastic it still has the chance to leach those chemicals into your drink, but it is partially better.<br /><br />But that is not why I love this bottle anyway.  I love it because it is cute and very unique. I don't think I will travel with it, but it has become my go to water bottle around the house. I especially would be reluctant to place it in a bag and expect it to not leak or break. The cap has proven leak proof in my use around the house and seems pretty secure with it's feather gaskets but I would not push it or leave it sideways.  If I had any criticism, I wish it was a little bigger. Perhaps I can find a taller mason jar to up the volume.<br /><br />Perhaps the best thing about this bottle though is the ability to take it apart for washing.  I have to use a bottle brush for my other bottles to get rid of bits from the dishwasher.  This is much easier.",0.9886,301,20.066666666666663,0.0,1.8965800000000002
"This is not a bag I would check on an airliner, but for day to day toting of soccer equipment and clothing, this is perfect.  We have two kids in Soccer now and we got them an Adidas bag to share before getting offered a reviewer bag from Amazon Vine.  They turned out to be nearly identical and we couldn't be happier with them.  They are light, but durably made.  They fit cleats, shin guards, ball, uniforms, socks, water bottle and snacks perfectly.  The bag looks very sharp and there are enough zippered containers to fit the other smaller items the kids need to carry.<br /><br />These are the perfect grab and go organizers for shuttling grade school sports kids around with.  I really don't think we could be happier with them, nor can I think of any feature we wish we had.",0.9869,168,24.0,0.0,2.29607
"Well this is an OK dartboard and I have liked it so far.  In college I threw a lot and had access to a couple of dorm room boards and this one seems a little light compared to the ones we used. The darts are definitely on the light side and have a tendency to bounce rather than stick.  But when I pulled my old darts out they stuck well enough.<br /><br />I wish the display was a little showier and that I could see it better from a distance, but it and the electronic scoring seems to work well.  I have definitely enjoyed throwing with my kids.  Perhaps they will someday do some league play.  They have definitely enjoyed playing cricket in the rec room. It is a cheaper board, but at a cheaper price so you are getting what you are paying for.  It seems solid enough though and we have liked having it.",0.9914,174,19.33333333333333,0.0,1.89742
"This is a very decent, but small dry bag - 10 Liter.  I was looking for a bag to put a dslr and telephoto lense into and unfortunately I should have gone up to 20 liters.  But I have no problems at all with this dry bag itself, it is well designed and will get plenty of use as a waterproof container in a day bag.  It is well constructed and I like the optional strap it came with.  Although again, this would be better for the larger bags.<br /><br />The waterproof material seems very good.  the mouth is a little less flexible than other bags that I have, but I have full faith in it's watertightness.  It feels like it should wear well and take the punishment it will need to take on a canoe trip.  The price is decent, and all in all this seems like a very nice bag. Perhaps 4.5 starts.<br /><br />The bonus phone bag is a little cheaper and I can't say that I'm a huge fan of it.  But it's a bonus and my aim was to get another good watertight bag for larger electronics.  This bag is great for that.",0.9952,232,21.09090909090909,0.1,1.92856
This is a great quality size 4 ball with nice bold graphics.  We have a houseful of upper elementary and middle school soccer players so this ball is perfect for us.

"I love this bottle for the simple elegant and masculine design.  I have had a fight with my youngest son about who gets it because he thinks it looks cool. Love the color and logo... I can't say anything but good things about it visually.  The top is actually a stopper which is a little unusual, and I would trust it to hold water if you were to knock it over on a table top, but I don't have much faith in it being leak proof in a backpack. It takes a little effort to pop it out, but I would think that it could easily be worked off.  So that limits it's use a bit, but still perfect for office desk, car, or to have handy on a table when working outside. Insulation seems pretty good too, ice stayed for several hours on countertop.<br /><br />And I'll say it again, this is a beautiful bottle",0.9885,182,22.75,0.0,2.29655
"First, I'm very happy with the price.  I have spent a lot more on poles that ultimately got forgotten in Denali and Washington.  If I can't keep ahold of them, it is better that they are reasonably priced.  Surprisingly I don't feel that these give up much in quality over my earlier, more expensive poles that cost twice as much.  The poles are rigid, even when extended out to their full height.  I'm 6'3&#34; so need them to be fully extended.  So you get packability without losing much on usability.  The different feet are very nice although I fear that I will have no idea where they are when it comes time to swap them for season or scenario.  For my personal uses, I have snowshoeing in Minnesota all summer and hiking in the Mojave in early spring.  So I like that this set will cover each nicely. The grips are good and feel comfortable in the hand.<br /><br />All in all these seem like very good poles.  Will update after they have been in the field a bit, but out of the box, I really love how they look and feel.",0.9602,228,19.0,0.0,2.2880599999999998
"This is a beautiful and wonderfully functional reel.  Aesthetically it is stunning with its brilliant white although that is not my purpose for purchasing a reel.  I want functionality...long lasting functionality. Right out of the box and mounted, it feels great.  The action is smooth and fluid.  I was able to get line onto it quickly.  The gearing just sucks up the lineage on each turn, perhaps faster than any reel I have owned.  There will be the test of time, but right now it is easily the smoothest working reel in my arsenal.<br /><br />I put a casting plug onto the line and tested it in the side yard (our open water season is pretty much done for the year.)  Casts were smooth and the bail flipped over consistently with perhaps a little more resistance than normal.  Again, the retrieve was fast, I would have imagine that they retrieve for a twister tail next spring will be very slow.<br /><br />I like the size, I put it on a single piece light rod that I typically use for crappie and walleye jigging on the river.  The only thing bad I can think of about this reel is that is came in November. March seems so far away...  I'll update as I see how well it takes abuse of actual fishing.",0.8126,259,19.923076923076923,0.0,2.24378
"First of all, I love the chug lid. It seems to be holding leaks in well, but really lets you drain the bottle when you have to.  I'm tired of gimmicky straws etcetera, it is nice that this gets out of the way and lets the refreshment flow. Also, like the BPA free, but question it's replacement.  I have been moving more and more to steel water bottles, but feel reasonably safe with this as long as the container is not used for storage.<br /><br />Due to unseasonably warm weather, this has been used on a last paddle and a bike ride and has held up very well.  Love the size, only knock I can find for it is that it does not fit my filter so I cannot use the screwtop lid from the filter.<br /><br />Classic good looks, few frills bottle.  Does everything I want a water bottle to do.  Well done.",0.9855,188,23.5,0.0,2.29565
"I have to admit that a week ago I had not heard of Pickleball.  Then when passing our park I saw that they had reconfigured a couple of our tennis courts and I looked it up.  Then I got a chance to get this set to review for Amazon.  And I am impressed.<br /><br />I have played Tennis a lot growing up but my kids and my partners family had not.  So I felt I was ok going into this but the surprise was how easily it came to the kids.  I found the game a little slower until you get to the no volley line where quick reflexes come into play.  We played for about a half an hour we decided that we needed to go get two more paddles so we could play doubles.  It is a nice game, which we played at a far easier pace than I think it can be taken to, although, I don't seeing it getting to the pace of tennis, or even ping pong for that matter.<br /><br />This set is for getting you going. The whiffle balls are solid and will hold up well. The paddles are pretty substantial and should hold up well too but noticeably not the quality of our other paddles.  The grips are comfortable and also seem constructed well enough to stand up to beginers. All in all a good starter pack, but not matching the quality of the pair of paddles we bought locally for almost twice the price.",0.9945,285,23.75,0.2,1.9583500000000003
"We got these for the end of the pool season and a snorkeling trip to the Keys. My hope was to get a workable pair for my fifteen year old and I couldn't be happier. Obviously these are not pro level, but they are a very workable lower mid range set of mask and snorkel.<br /><br />The best thing about it is comfort and fit. He had no problems with them on his maiden dive in our backyard pool. The mask has a fairly tight view but again, very workable. It was easy to size it for him and he is very happy with it. We are now all equipped and ready to go.<br /><br />For the price this is a very decent set and you could do a lot worse and not a whole lot better.",0.9784,161,23.0,0.0,2.29352
"This is a rather decent play set.  The construction is fine, not the highest, but it looks like it will take some abuse.  We got it for the summer season, which has not quite arrived in Minnesota yet but we have been able to use the discs as Frisbees and as paddle balls. They work fine for both.  They are not the strongest flying discs and not the best &#34;paddleball&#34; paddles, but the kids had a fun hour playing with them and we expect to use them a lot this summer once we get our 17 foot diameter pool up and running.<br /><br />Pluses<br />+ Decent Construction<br />+ Like the pool specific designs<br />+ Flexible, Frisbee\ball game<br /><br />Cons<br />- There is no way this ball will stay in the pool",0.1378,178,35.6,0.0,1.64134
"I can't say that this waterproof bag says high end quality, but I trust it for my upcoming trip to the Boundary Waters in Minnesota.  And while there is no signal in the BWCA, I do appreaciate having my phone as a clock/alarm/camera and I do like this bag for it's protection.  The plastic is not the thickest and the seams do not appear to be very rugged, and I have some doubts about the seams on the mouth of the bag.  They are reinforced but still that is an area that would feel a lot of wear and tear in use.<br /><br />The fit is tight and it is not a pull it in and toss it quickly back in bag.  The seal is a compression lock that pushes the vinyl bag shut on the top.  there is no fold or other thing to improve the seal, but it should be fine for quick, accidental immersions.  In tests it had not problem keeping water out. The locking mechanisms are tight and I don't foresee them popping open.<br /><br />All in all this is a decent but not deluxe bag.  I'm glad to have it for my trip and plan to use it throughout the summer paddling season.",0.9534,240,26.666666666666668,0.0,1.88602
"This is a luxuriously huge umbrella. Six feet wide keeps a lot of kids dry and it have a rich feel.  There are a couple of trade offs with the size, it is a little top heavy and the wind can catch it, but there are some nice slits built into the canopy of the umbrella that allows some of the air to go through.  So far I have not used it in a gale force wind, but it has handled the small gusts I have used it in with no problems.<br /><br />I love the blue and black coloring and the whole thing looks beautiful. It is so big that it has two separate velcroed tabs to tie the sides down as well as a tight fitting sleeve that keeps the whole umbrella tidy, but it is hard to get it on and off so it probably will not be put back on mine.",0.9601,171,34.2,0.0,2.28803

"Works well for my needs.  We have a small 14 foot fishing boat and an aluminum dock and we were just looking for a little protection when bringing the boat in.  These are very good dock bumpers for our purposes and do the job we are asking of it.  The only bad thing is that mine did not come with the straps pictured, which I would guess was because I got a free reviewer set.  I needed to rig some straps from some other nylon strapping I had laying around.<br /><br />I do think these work a little better than the rounded bumpers we had looked at, because I am able to adjust their placement well. Although again, we are talking a 14 foot lund so it is not a whole lot of weight to be tossed around in waves.  We only use them when coming into dock and end up pulling our boat out of the water.  Not sure that I would depend on them for must protection in high waves.",0.746,190,23.75,0.0,1.8238
"I started a club with band strength training and I have been building up a home/travel collection of bands to use and I really like the Black Mountain bands they have a slightly different feel to their handles but the quality matches what they have in the gymn and the other, apparently no name bands that I received as a gift.<br /><br />I will be looking to fill in more of the bands as budget allows, and I think I'm going to go with a set of the fixed Black Mountain bands as they appear to be fairly decent quality.<br /><br />As for a workout, if you are thinking about using bands, they are effective and all your truly need to get toned.  I use them in the gymn setting and the workouts go by fast, can easily be increased to make sure you are reaching muscle failure and are flexible for all major muscle groups.

"This is an OK water bottle.  It's a little thin walled and does not seem particularly rugged which is probably my biggest concern.  The thin walls are soft and feel a little like a slightly stronger disposeable water bottle. The construction and fact that the bottle is recyclable makes this bottle seem pretty disposeable.<br /><br />The cap is a little hard to get off, especially for my youngest son. Otherwise the design of the bottle is fine and workable.<br /><br />The filter is an ok touch.  I don't mind having a charcoal filter for flavor and some cleaning of pollutants.  I'm also not too concerned about the 300 bottles before you need to replace the filter.  The bottle itself does not feel like it will last 300 refills.

"I really appreciate that I can leave this rack in my car so it is always ready.  But this really comes with a lot of trade offs.  This is not a quickly installed bike carrier.  It takes time to set up the legs and straps, and once in place the carrier is not the most rugged solutions.  I have only carried one bike on it at and after putting my bike on, there is some question about how well the second bike would go on.<br /><br />I don't want to sound to against the rack.

"I was really looking forward to getting this as a way to work my core without having to do sit ups or other back stressing exercises.  I had seen a number of videos showing how trainer balls work to develop core strength at the same time as building balance.  Of course I've also seen a lot of videos about exercise jousting.  Unfortunately I showed these to my sons and they went nuts. Suddenly it was the coolest ""toy"" they had.  It was used in ambushes, kickball games, as a trampoline, and on and on.  My youngest even slept with it for a while.  None of this was intended but it definitely earned it's money on this alone, let alone the workouts.<br /><br />One thing that my boys did prove in spades, is that this can take some abuse and keep on going. It has survived their roughhousing with no signs of wear and tear.  But back to the reason I got it.<br /><br />As an exercise device I find it challenging.  Doing pushups while holding while pressing down the ball does add whole levels of complexity.  I have mixed it in to my routine substituting it for kettle bells to mix things up a little.  I love that they placed the routine on the side of the ball so it is inherently always there when you need it.  It seems a little kitschy, but the workout seems ok although sometimes it seems more a novelty than a serious work out.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Rugid construction<br />+ Easy to use<br />+ Fun for everyone for other uses<br />+ Exercises printed on the ball is brilliant<br />+ Core exercises that don't stress the back.<br /><br />Cons<br />- big, takes up some room to store<br />- had an odor for a while, but a few rounds of kick ball and trips to the pool solved that.<br />- still seems a little like novelty gear, like a thigh master",0.9671,412,29.428571428571427,0.1,2.32013

"This is lots of fun. I imagine any balance bike would be a blast for kids too young to learn to ride a real bike, but this one is exceptional for its value and portability. My son loved this bike immediately. He spent the first couple of months just walking around on it, then started to really get going. Now he runs along, picks up speed, then lifts his legs and coasts, learning the balancing skill that will help him learn to ride a bike later, and seriously having a blast. He rides it about an hour each day (inside too!); it's probably his favorite thing in the world. I even ordered him a second one so he'd have it during a long summer vacation. It would have fit in my large suitcase, but it costs less than a airline's second bag fee.<br /><br />It's durable. We got a few cosmetic scratches pretty quickly, but nothing that matters has ever gone wrong. The seat is height adjustable. The bike is super light and small. I toss it in the trunk when I take the kids to the park and find it lighter and easier to wrangle than my older child's Razr scooter. The handlebars tend to go out of alignment, but it's a cinch to straighten them out again.<br /><br />My son got this for his 2nd birthday. He's in the 50th %ile and it was the right size for him. We raised the seat to a higher setting 6 months later but he's still not maxed out. I think in all the bike will last him about 18 months, from age 2 to about 3 1/2. So if your kid is over 3 and average to tall, it might be too late for this bike. Everyone else: If you're thinking about this bike, order it now! The sooner you get it, the longer your kid can enjoy it. It's fun and a fantastic value.",0.994,388,18.476190476190474,0.0,2.2982

Then I just velcro it snugly and she wears it up till bedtime.<br />I bought the original Anxiety shirt for a lot more and liked this one much better. It was easier to put on and the material was a lot lighter weight. The other one would have been way too hot for the summer months.,0.8008,105,17.5,0.1,1.8702400000000001

"Let me start by telling you that I'm a fit 135 lb 5'6 woman with a 27"" waist. In order to wear this I have to cinch it up and I used safety pins on both sides to hold the excess straps from flapping around. The pack itself is great for carrying your phone, keys, gels, etc while running or riding your bike. The problem is the quality of this belt. I bought it in March 2019 and by July 2019 (just 4 months later) it is already falling apart. I only use this at most 2 times a week while cycling to hold my phone. I have another smaller pack with an elastic waistband I prefer for running. The neoprene like material used on the sides of the pack seems to be a very bad choice. If Nathan fixes this defect it would truly be a fantastic belt. I love how the top zipper entry makes the accessibility super nice! It makes pulling your phone in and out much easier(especially while riding) much better than on the front of the pack. There is a separate zipper compartment on the bottom which I use to carry my chapstick. Top zip pack rule! If the belt had a stretchy elastic belt that would also increase the desirability of this wait pack. Nathan fix this issue! Not good business if customers are having to replace something just 4 short months later:/ I should have listened to the many other reviewers who also complained about the same problem...... live and learn.

"I absolutely love the light.  It is a well made super bright light with different modes that are perfect for day and night.  I took off one star because one light stopped working after a few months of use on my road bike.  I returned it for repair and it ended up being a bad solder joint - so I was told.  The problem was that Cygolite never sent an email that they received my light, never sent any updates, and after almost three weeks of not hearing anything, I had to call them to get some answers.  I got a sincere apology for the lack of communication and the delay in the repair but it still took a few more days to get it back - they are located 45 minutes from me.  If this light wasn't so awesome, I would have taken off 2 or 3 stars for the lousy repair experience.",-0.808,166,23.714285714285715,0.5,1.5076

The second light did not have any problems with the zoom, but the light would flicker when I hit any kind of bumps when riding.  I cleaned the contacts and replaced the batteries but it didn't help.  The free red rear light was worthless, it would shut off with any bumps in the road - the first one and second one did the same thing.  I returned the first and second lights for a refund.

I am replacing a set that I have had for 5+ years.  These are about 30% smaller than the ones I was using.  Since these are much smaller in length and width, they don't have as much liquid inside them so they don't even last thru a full day - I am using 2 of these cool packs in my cooler.  They are made of a very thin plastic which I don't believe will last very long before they start to leak.  Overall I am very disappointed in the product and the quality.  I only saw one other manufacturer of a 6 pack cool pack on Amazon, so I will probably try ordering those and see if they are better?  That's my 2 cents......",0.8333,260,26.0,0.1,1.07999

"We like to have fun in the office but unfortunately there are certain things we cannot have there, like a real dart board mounted on the wall. I chose this set as the solution to that problem. It’s a little bit different than regular darts but it’s still a lot of fun and it meets the safety requirements that are in place there.<br /><br />This kind of set has been around for a while – felt-like board, velcro-lined balls. It comes down to how well your aim is when tossing or throwing the balls. The target is set up a bit differently than a traditional dart board and is more in line with what kids would play, but that’s the point – it’s suitable for kids as well as adults, and can be played anywhere. The target has two sides, one with point zones more similar to a traditional board (but still very different) and the other side has point circles as well as “lose” circles. Depending on what mood your group is in, either is suitable for a quick game.<br /><br />This is a very lightweight and portable game. It packs easily and doesn’t take up much room in luggage. It would have been nice to have a carry bag with it, even if it was just a nylon baggie that does little more than keep everything together.<br /><br />I have not used the hanging hook. I have found different ways to hang the target.<br /><br />This is a fun and easy game that can be played almost anywhere and doesn’t require a lot of thought. It’s easy to understand, easy to play, and it doesn’t introduce some of the safety issues that a traditional dart game does.",0.9949,358,32.54545454545455,0.0,2.29847
"I selected this holster to go with a Glock 17. I wanted it more for protecting the piece rather than concealed carry, and for that it seems to be just fine. I have not had this very long and I haven't worked with it much but so far I am pleased with it.<br /><br />The holster is lightweight, made of Kydex which feels a lot like plastic but is more durable while not adding significant weight. It seems to be assembled well and the screws holding it together are tight. Nothing shifts or moves that shouldn't, and that's a good sign. So far, I have no complaints with the assembly.<br /><br />I am very especially pleased that it is made such that the trigger is completely concealed and inaccessible, so that you can't pull it out with your finger on the trigger which is a common mistake.<br /><br />The Glock for which it is designed fits perfectly, snapping in place nicely without requiring a lot of effort to put it in or pull it out, but still connecting tightly enough to keep it from falling out accidentally.<br /><br />The holster is low profile so it is well suited for concealed carry. It clips firmly to a belt and it is easy to conceal when properly equipped.<br /><br />I like this holster and so far I am pleased with it. It seems to be made very well, if fits the intended piece perfectly and it is lightweight so it doesn't add appreciable weight. If you are looking for a lightweight and rugged holster, this is a good one to consider.",0.9949,327,36.333333333333336,0.0,2.29847
"I have only recently become familiar with Tempo as a brand in fishing gear and up to this point my experiences with them have been positive. I selected this reel for freshwater use and I chose a smaller size for use on lighter tackle. So far it has been a good reel and it has performed well, but I am a little disappointed in the finish on this one. The QC isn’t quite where it should be and it comes off as a slightly rough test unit instead of a polished retail reel.<br /><br />I chose the Expert 3000 model as I wanted a smaller reel for catching panfish with lighter tackle. This is a smaller reel than I usually work with, and in use it has proven itself to not be any harder or easier than larger reels for me. It is lighter than usual, though, and that’s a good thing in this case.<br /><br />It is smooth in the cast and receive which is all I really can ask. There are no hitches in the spinning action, no strange sounds, and the bail flips properly. The drag is easy to set and works well too. The greatest strength of this reel is actually the zero-reverse clutch - this reel gives exactly nothing when the zero reverse clutch is engaged. Many reels allow for a tiny amount of reverse play, but this one does not.<br /><br />Operationally, this reel is fine and I have no complaints at all. Where I have an issue with this reel is in the fit and finish. The reel body is put together with star screws, and some of these protrude slightly and are rough to the touch. The more serious issue is the spool, though, which has sharp edges on the parallel cuts, sharp enough to feel easily and could under the right circumstances damage line if there is a backlash or rat’s nest. Neither of these issues are enough to make this reel unusable, but at the price point the reel should be pretty close to perfect.<br /><br />I do like this reel and I will get good service out of it. It works very well and it is lightweight, perfect for the lake where I plan to use it. My main reservation is just in the finish, where it seems some attention to detail is lacking.",0.9944,460,28.75,0.0,1.89832
"I have only recently became aware of Tempo as a tackle manufacturer and so far my experiences with their rods and reels have been positive. I selected this specific reel for saltwater use. So far it has been a fine reel and has worked out well for me.<br /><br />I selected the 6000 size which is the largest available. I have large hands, and the type of fish I am targeting will need some room to run when hooked. This is a good-sized reel and it has some excellent attributes.<br /><br />The body itself is aluminum (according to the product description; I thought it was graphite) and is resistant to corrosion and rust which is good. It has a nice, smooth finish and I like the aesthetics of it. It’s gray with gold paint and some chrome-colored trim, eye catching but not gaudy.<br /><br />In operation this reel is a smooth operator. The cast and retrieve are smooth in terms of what the reel handles; that is, line peels off easily and the retrieve is smooth and glassy, though this can be impacted negatively by what rod you use. It has an excellent zero-reverse clutch and when engaged gives no reverse play at all, not even a tiny bit. The drag system is also very good and it can be set to be very stiff and unyielding for larger fish or soft and sensitive for smaller fish.<br /><br />The handle is surprisingly large, bigger than that of most reels. For smaller hands it might be a little awkward because of the size, but for me it is very comfortable and easy to work with.<br /><br />This is a nice reel and so far I am happy with it. It works smoothly and it seems to be made very well, and the fact that it looks attractive is a plus. The price point is the cherry on top that makes it easy to recommend.",0.9953,386,29.692307692307693,0.1,2.3285899999999997
"Note: There are several products attached to this listing. I am specifically writing this review for the 6' light-to-moderate fast action rod.<br /><br />I selected this rod to go with a new reel I have, with the intention of hitting the lake and going after largemouth bass. This has proven to be a nice rod that has worked out well for me.<br /><br />When this rod arrived, it came in a heavy cardboard tube and was secured inside with foam rubber. Most rods I have ordered online come in a plastic wrap and packed in a light cardboard box. This was a huge surprise but was positive - the likelihood of this rod getting damaged in shipping is very low.<br /><br />The rod is in two section (which is typical) and it assembles as expected and in negligible time. When fully assembled the rod is 6' as advertised. Attaching the reel I had in mind was minimal effort too, and I was ready to go to the lake in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />The eyes in the rod provide little to no resistance to the line during the cast. I have dealt with rods that hinder the cast; this one does not.<br /><br />This is a sensitive rod and I have had no issues feeling when the fish hit. Being light to medium, pulling in a good-sized fish is a bit of work but it's not any more difficult than other rods of this type I have used.<br /><br />It seems to be made well and I have found no problems with damage to the rod, loose eye ties, or a loose cuff for the reel which I have seen with some rods. With proper care this rod should last for several years.<br /><br />I have not had this rod long but so far all indicators are good. It seems to be made well, it was very definitely packaged well, and it performs nicely. It is reasonably priced too.",0.9752,406,33.833333333333336,0.0,2.29256
"I selected this first aid kit to carry with me while backpacking. My thinking is that it is small and light and will have the basics down. I also knew that a full first aid kit would be better, but the asking price is low enough that it makes sense for many situations. The kit itself is fine, but like other reviews have stated the case in which the kit is stored is terrible.<br /><br />I won’t rehash the contents of the kit - that’s in the product description.<br /><br />The case is a side-latch case about the size of a deck of cards. The whole problem is the hinge. Mine came out of the package cracked and I can see a gap in the plastic where it should be closed around the pin, and it is a matter of time before it snaps completely and won’t close at all. My solution was to move everything to a small Lock-n-Lock which is actually waterproof and can take a lot more abuse. I will try to fix the original case with a glue gun and hope that it holds up better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this kit, even at the low asking price. The whole point of this kit is a small, compact and water resistant kit that can go anywhere. Instead, this is a kit with a fragile container that you’ll need to replace, and in that case it makes more sense to get a different kit anyway.",-0.6762,295,29.5,0.0,0.59714
"I use fingerless gloves when I am working with my camera as they keep my hands warm enough without interfering with my operation of the camera controls. I selected these for that purpose, and though they're overkill for such a purpose so far I am happy with them.<br /><br />These are stretchy gloves and they fit well. The palm is a leather-like material with silicone pads and the backs are stretchy so they will fit decently and flex when you make a fist or lift something. The stitching is tight and I could not find any loose strings or uneven sewing so these should last reasonably well (good stitching is no guarantee but it's a good start out of the gate).<br /><br />I like the wrist straps. They can be tightened down to make the gloves more secure, and the straps also provide some absorption protection for the wrists.<br /><br />In my particular case the gel padding across the palm is actually a hindrance as I do not use these gloves for heavy lifting or grabbing. It almost feels like it's in the way at times. This is not a fault in the design but a mismatch between the gloves and the use case. For using just for warmth when working with light equipment there are better choices.<br /><br />These are decent gloves and I anticipate getting good service from them. They're comfortable, made well and have some nice features to them.",0.9922,289,32.111111111111114,0.1,2.32766
"I have always preferred spinning reels to bait casters and spin casters (push button) reels, and I am always looking for decent reels. I selected this one in the 3000 size, and so far I am pleased with it. It operates smoothly and seems to be made well.<br /><br />Tempo is a name relatively new to me and I wasn't too sure what to expect in terms of performance. I can't find too much online about the company so there's not much to go on when researching the brand.<br /><br />Lack of information aside, I have been pleased with this reel. It is a very smooth operator with a smooth, buttery retrieve and easy casts. Monofilament line peels off easily during the cast and I have not had any issues with hitches or snags. The bail flips easily like it should which is a problem I have seen with some other reels. I like the zero reverse which works very well on this reel. The drag is easy to adjust, too.<br /><br />The whole assembly is lightweight and not burdensome. In spite of this, it feels very solid and it should be able to handle years of abuse with a little routine maintenance.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this reel and will be using it more over the coming weeks and months. So far it is a smooth and reliable operator, it has a good feel in the hands, it is lightweight and it just works like it's supposed to work without any glitches.",0.973,308,28.0,0.1,2.3219
"I selected these fingerless gloves for the purpose of using them on cold mornings when out with my camera. These are not specifically cold weather gloves but they're acceptable protection from the cold. So far I'm happy with them.<br /><br />The main issue I have with most gloves is finding gloves that fit me properly. I have huge hands so often gloves that are made for large or extra-large hands still don't quite fit. I selected the extra-large size and these actually fit me, though they are slightly snug. They do not feel strained when I wear them and ball my fist, nor do they feel constricting. That's a huge plus for me.<br /><br />These are more substantial than typical gloves that one would wear for warmth. They're reinforced at the knuckles and are made to stretch under strain. These will work for weightlifting, though I probably would opt for something a little more substantial still in that specific context (that's just me).<br /><br />Working with the camera these don't get in the way or slow me down, and that's really my main concern. They keep my hands warm enough to matter while my fingers are exposed enough to work the camera controls.<br /><br />I like these gloves and expect to get many seasons of use from them. They're comfortable, they fit me properly and they work in the context for which I got them without getting in the way.",0.9913,296,26.90909090909091,0.2,2.35739
"I have favored spinning reels over other types of fishing reels since I was a kid, and I am always looking for a good reel for freshwater. I only recently became aware of 13 Fishing as a brand and my experiences so far have been positive. This reel has also given me a positive experience and I am not unhappy with it.<br /><br />I selected the 4.0 size. This reel is lightweight and yet feels solid, made of metal and graphite. The retrieve is smooth and I don't feel any grinding or catches during the retrieve which is good. The bail flips like it should (a problem I have had with some other reels I have worked with in the past) and I have had no issue with the drag setting.<br /><br />It is suitable for right- or left-handed retrieve. I am a bit of an odd duck in that I am very right-handed but I use my reels in a left-handed configuration; switching the handle between either configuration to the other is easy and takes minimal effort.<br /><br />Side by side with my Quantum reels and my KastKing reels, I would say this one is competitive in quality and function. It is priced reasonably, too.<br /><br />I have not had this reel long so I can't say it will hold up under heavy use yet but time till tell.

"I usually have a knife in my pocket and usually feel like I am missing something when I go out the door without one. I don't need a multi-tool or a Swiss army knife, just a simple blade most of the time. I only recently became aware of Old Timer as a brand, and so far I am very pleased with this knife. It sticks to the basics and it gets them right.<br /><br />This is a retro-looking knife, made with a bone handle and sporting just two blades. One of the blades is a more typical pointed pocket knife blade and the other is more rounded. This is a knife well suited for whittling and carving.<br /><br />The knife is made very well. the blades are tight and have no side-to-side wobble which is a problem I have seen in many cheaper knives. The blades are not spring-assisted and must be pulled out manually which is all right, this is just one less thing to break. The handle is tight and I cannot feel any shifting when I fiddle with it.<br /><br />And of course, this knife looks great. The bone handle gives this knife an old-fashioned look that is similar to older knives I have seen when I was a kid and was looking at pocket knives that were already old. This is an heirloom type of knife that is meant to be passed down for generations.<br /><br />This knife is a beauty and will serve you well.

"I selected these for my son who likes to wear shades while shooting hoops. It became apparent very quickly that these are not one-size-fits-all.<br /><br />These are not well-suited for people with larger or even average heads - the fit is a little snug and they are uncomfortable. They do fit, if you're willing to deal with them being on the tight side and pressing against the sides of your face. On a smaller person they work better and are much more comfortable.<br /><br />These are not the best fit and I would not choose these unless they're for someone with a smaller face/head. They're just too small to fit the average person.",0.6276,136,27.2,0.0,0.98828
"I have a pocket knife in my pocket at all times and I have found having one on me is almost always useful. I had not heard of Old Timer until recently, but their knives look nice and I thought I would give them a chance. So far I am very pleased with this particular knife.<br /><br />This is a no-frills knife that doesn't try to get too fancy. The blades have to be pulled open manually without a spring assist, and it does not have some of the things that other knives frequently have such as a corkscrew, screwdriver and other integrated emergency tools. Instead it has three blades - nothing more. Each blade is different and has different uses, though the thought that comes to mind when I look at the knife as a whole is whittling and carving.<br /><br />The blades are tight and do not wobble. That's a good thing and says that the knife as a whole is assembled well. The blades feel solid and secure when opened.<br /><br />I love the bone handle. It feels good in the hand and it looks retro which is a good thing. The texture makes it easy to maintain a grip, even when hands are just a little wet.<br /><br />This is a smallish knife, so it will fit in your pocket and not take up lots of room. This is a little smaller than most knives I am used to carrying, and that's a mixed bag to me - on one hand I like having a larger knife, probably because I am used to having one, but on the other I like the fact that it is small, compact and lightweight.<br /><br />This is a very nice knife that sticks to getting the basics right without a bunch of extras that only add weight and take away from the overall package.

"I have always preferred spinning reels to other types of reels so I was naturally drawn to this one. I have large hands and I like using larger reels so I selected the 5.0 size reel, So far I am pleased with it. It is not a top-of-the-line reel but it is more than sufficient for my needs and it should last a long time.<br /><br />This reel has some heft without being too heavy. It is all aluminum and it should last for many years with proper care and upkeep, though it should also be able to handle some abuse too. Operation is smooth - cast and retrieve are smooth, retrieve is quiet, and so far I haven't felt any catches while reeling like I have with some other rigs.<br /><br />The reel is all black with some chrome accents to it. It looks sharp, though the chrome does have a cheaper look to it when compared to the black reel body. This is a cosmetic thing and so far is really the only negative I have found about this reel.<br /><br />This is a decent reel at a decent price point. Operation is smooth, it looks good and it is made well. It should last a long time if properly maintained and is less expensive than some of the more well-known brands. If you're on a smaller budget but you want a decent reel for everyday use, this one is worth consideration.",0.7434,284,28.4,0.0,2.22302
"I have not previously worked with Old Timer knives, though I have had my share of pocket knives that have served me well. So, this is my first experience with this brand and so far I am very pleased. This is a quality pocket knife, without a lot of frills and fancy features but very well made and attractive.<br /><br />Most cheap pocket knives have a plastic handle, spring-assisted fly-out blade, and a locking mechanism. Beyond that the features become quite varied and bring different features to the table. That's all good, but anything beyond the basics - a blade in a case - adds weight and size. This knife is different. It keeps everything very simple - a single pull-out blade that locks. That's it.<br /><br />The blade is solid and sharp right out of the package and is well suited for most tasks. There is no wobble in the blade and it remains stiff and tight, which is a good thing. The blade is free of pits and dings (at least initially) and is sharp enough to cut without pain (so be careful).<br /><br />The handle is bone, not cheap plastic or resin. It has a nice, solid feel to it and it will last for decades with proper care. It also has eye appeal and is reminiscent of old-fashioned knives.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this knife and will carry it instead of a larger cheap knife when I want a small, lightweight but well-made knife with me. I expect to get years of service from this knife.",0.9881,320,24.615384615384617,0.0,2.29643
"I selected this disc for my son as he loves to play disc golf. I have gone with him a few times, and I can see the attraction, but he is far better than I ever will be so I handed this disc off to him for testing. In a nutshell, it’s a decent disc with some fit-and-finish issues.<br /><br />It came in a nice package that protected it well, but once out of the package it became evident that there are some manufacturing issues. The lip around the edge should be smooth when it is brand new and instead this one has burrs and dings that make it feel used even though it is not. It is not enough to make it unusable though. The inside lip is slightly uneven, like the disc was either handled while still hot or was molded incorrectly. Again, it’s not enough to make the disc unusable but it is noticeable.<br /><br />In flight it flies reasonably true when thrown properly. I can’t throw a regular frisbee straight to save my life and disc golf discs are no better for me, but in my son’s hands he can throw it fairly straight. We did not measure the range in an open field and we did not weight it to see if it’s within spec before using it, so we cannot say for sure that it’s made to the stated specs, but it seems to be within reason for a driver disc.<br /><br />The price makes this disc worth consideration more than anything. There are cheaper discs and there are much more expensive discs on the market, and this one is priced closer to the lower end.<br /><br />This is an ok driver disc. It has some manufacturing defects that take away from the finished product, but it works well enough as a driver and is better than the most basic budget discs.",0.9866,381,34.63636363636363,0.0,1.8959800000000002
"Where many users of these tubes would select these for camping or taking along in wet environments, I have a completely different use for these - I selected them for geocaching. This is a common container style for use with geocaching so I thought these might be a good fit for that. While they are, I was surprised by the size (even though the listing clearly states the sizes).<br /><br />This is a set of three bison tubes, made of machined aluminum and fitted with a rubber gasket to create a water-tight seal when these are closed properly. The gasket also serves as a sort of lock washer and prevents each tube from easily unscrewing itself when jostled.<br /><br />When sealed and submerged underwater for a length of time, these pass the waterproof test. Contents of each remained bone dry which is really one of the main points of a container like this.<br /><br />The largest of these is sufficiently large to hold a writing utensil or a house key. I would hesitate to say it can hold a lot because, while it is a larger-than-average bison tube, it is not huge.<br /><br />With the carabiners attached to these it is easy to snap these to a belt loop, bag strap or a tree branch.<br /><br />I have found nothing about these that I find off-putting and I am pleased to recommend them if you need a water-tight and sturdy container (or set of containers) that can hold smaller items while protecting them. These seem to be made well and the cost is reasonable.",0.9705,318,45.42857142857143,0.1,2.32115
"My house is full of basketball nuts and as such we have gone through numerous basketballs over the years. We haven't had any get punctured but we've had numerous ones that have gotten smooth to the point of being slippery and hard to grasp when they get wet. Normally we have gotten the cheap, toy store variety and those last about a year; this is the first good one we've gotten in quite a while. So far it has worked out well.<br /><br />We have the indoor/outdoor ball. It has a nice grip to it and so far we have had no issues with it slipping or getting away from any of us in play. Being relatively new it certainly should not have any such issues, but it's good out of the gate. It feels a bit more ""grippy"" than cheaper balls and this ball is easier to palm than other basketballs with a more rubbery exterior. It has good bounce and dribbles well.<br /><br />As a sanity check I made sure it's actually round. There's no fixing an oblong ball, and this one is just fine in that regard.<br /><br />So far this has been a good ball. Time will tell how well it holds up under heavy (daily) outdoor use, but it already seems to be better than most cheaper balls we've had.",0.987,272,27.2,0.1,2.3261
"I ordered this folding chair after I discovered that the one I use most often is finally starting to fall apart. My wife has been wanting a newer one anyway. This one came as a bit of a surprise and it is better than I expected.<br /><br />The chair itself is very compact when stored, taking up about half of the space of typical hunting or beach chairs like this. That was a little startling and I was actually a little unsettled when I unboxed it. I realized that the segments came apart but I did not know the chair broke down this compactly.<br /><br />The description says “1-minute set-up”. That’s a little ambitious but I will say it took very little time to set up from the time it came out of the nylon carrier to the time it was completely assembled and ready. It clearly takes more time than most folding chairs of this basic design, and the extra time was in getting the frame completely set up properly. There was a small amount of effort required to get the actual fabric attached but this wasn’t too hard.<br /><br />The chair itself seems very lightweight and I was concerned that it would not support me, but I was pleasantly surprised when I sat in it and it didn’t flinch. It is surprisingly comfortable too, though the lumbar support is minimal.<br /><br />Teardown is quick and easy, and it took me slightly more time to disassemble the chair than to assemble it. I was able to get it back into the bag without too much effort, either.<br /><br />This is a decent folding chair that’s suitable to taking just about anywhere, It’s small enough to fit inside a backpack, it is easy to set up and tear down, and it’s comfortable.",0.9911,370,37.0,0.1,2.32733
"A good first aid kit is a good thing to keep in the car when traveling and I selected this kit to keep in one of the vehicles because all of us are road warriors these days. Of course, the hope is that it is never needed, but when one is needed it's an invaluable resource. This is an interesting kit, and it has some pluses and minuses.<br /><br />This is a small kit that fits nicely under a seat, in a seat pocket, or in a center console. Finding a place for it in a car or truck should be no issue at all.<br /><br />There's a lot going on in this kit. It has a lot of the typical first aid items - bandages, gauze, cotton swabs, anticeptic wipes, and even a foil emergency blanket. There's some really odd things in here too - a flint, a compass, a whistle and a multi-tool are the stand-outs. This is not a typical first-aid kit but is also a basic survival kit.<br /><br />The multi-tool is the standout in the whole kit and is worth the cost of the whole kit. It seems to be made fairly well, it is heavier than some of the cheaper ones I have seen and used and it has the basic tools you'd expect - pliers, a knife, screwdriver, etc. It includes a set of bits as well.<br /><br />The compass is relatively cheap but it does work.<br /><br />The remainder of the components in this kit are farily nondescript. All will work in an emergency capacity.<br /><br />As a first aid kit this isn't so bad. However, this thing tries to be a survival kit as well, and on that basis there's an important omission - there's no flashlight in this kit. Even a small $5 flashlight would make this kit more complete and capable.<br /><br />This certainly isn't a bad kit, but it tries to be two different things and as a survival kit it comes up a little short. This will serve well for a traveling family and in a pinch it will make a decent emergency kit, but I would not rely on it as a sole source.",0.9537,458,35.23076923076923,0.0,1.88611
"My family loves family game night though most of the time we have kept it to board games and (occasionally) air hockey. We've wanted a ping pong table for a while as well as foosball table but have lacked the space for those. This table is the answer. However, there is an important consideration when choosing this (or similar) multi-game table.<br /><br />This is a mostly pre-assembled game table; just fold out the legs, drop in the foosball poles, add the handles for the foosball game and you're ready to go. Change the top tier for the game you want and you have multiple games at the ready. It has seven games available - foosball, air hockey (more on that in a minute), shuffleboard, bowling, ping pong, backgammon and chess.<br /><br />I was curious about how the air hockey function would work since this is a non-electric table and there does need to be air to make the puck float. As it turns out, the magic is in the puck. It's USB-rechargeable and it generates enough air flow around itself to glide sufficiently on the table to work. We have an air hockey table that plugs in in the basement; I haven't tried this puck with that table but want to try it to see if it works good with that table too.<br /><br />All of these games are great. There is one important consideration though. The games are smaller than a standard table. That is, this is not a full-sized ping pong table, foosball table, or air hockey table. I am not sure about the bowling or shuffleboard games - I have never worked with these before. And the backgammon and chess table doesn't have a ""standard"" size unless you're playing in a tournament.<br /><br />Other than the size we have been enjoying this table quite a bit. It has brought out the competition in all of us and we have really appreciated having the variety without having to chew up large amounnts of space. The size is actually an advantage in one distinct way - because it is smaller, the table is lighter than if it had been a full-sized one and as such is a lot easier to move when we need to put it in a different room.<br /><br />Everything needed to play is in the box - ping pong balls and paddles, a foosball ball, full set of chess pieces and more. This is a complete set and requires nothing else.<br /><br />We're very happy with this table game set and plan to play heavily. With the variety of games it provides, and all of the equipment included, this is a good bet for the competitive family. Just keep in mind that the size is smaller than standard.",0.9959,558,29.36842105263158,0.2,2.3587700000000003
"I have for years loved fishing and I still have my original fishing reel, a vintage Zebco 33 that still works and I still use on occasion. I have been through countless rods, though. I selected this combo set with my son in mind who prefers the spincasting design of reels, and so far he and I are both pleased with this combo. It seems to be made well and it is well suited for most freshwater fishing.<br /><br />The reel is an updated Zebco 33, a step forward from my old vintage model in terms of smoothness and operation, though the functionality is basically the same. Push the button to release line for casting, and start reeling to retrieve. It has a solid anti-reverse (though not a zero-reverse clutch). And, the drag is set via a thumb wheel that is easy to turn. This reel has two advantages over its older sibling: it has a nice, large handle so the retrieve is a lot faster, and the handle is reversible so it can be used by anyone and not just right-handers like me.<br /><br />The rod is a nice, medium-action rod that will hold up well to decent-sized fighting fish. It assembles easily and the eyes are all-metal.<br /><br />Casting is smooth and easy with this combo. The reel itself is a smooth operator and so far I have had no hang-ups with the cast. The rod does well in casting too, and even though the eyes are very simple the line glides easily through and we have seen no issues with the line catching or being slowed down through the rod’s eyes.<br /><br />So far, we have no complaints with this combo and we’re already looking forward to more time on the lake with it. It’s a thoughtful combo rod and reel and it works smoothly. It is well-suited for most freshwater applications and with some basic maintenance should last for years.",0.9813,386,29.692307692307693,0.0,2.29439
"Note: There are multiple products attached to this listing. I am specifically writing this review for the 67-piece assortment.<br /><br />Fishing is something I have enjoyed since I was a little kid and I have worked with more forms of lures and tackle than I can remember. As a kid I never understood why there were so many different kinds of lures and what drew my attention to any given lure was unrelated to what actually worked. I understand the difference now, and I have a better appreciation for what kinds of lures to use and when, depending on what kinds of fish I am trying to catch. This assortment is a good starter kit for a lot of different types of fishing situations and the lures themselves seem to be decently made.<br /><br />This assortment has a lot going on. There are worms, grubs, spinners, spoons, poppers and frogs; hooks, line weights and swivels. There are even spare parts like extra plastic spacing beads and spinners. This covers a very wide range of fishing types, from bass and pike to smaller panfish. If you’re looking for a decent starter kit for pursuing various types of freshwater fish using artificial baits, this is a great kit that has a little of almost everything. Fly lures are the one thing that are absent.<br /><br />One of the best pieces of advice I have ever received in the course of fishing is to always use baits that the fish will recognize as a food source. That is, if all of the school fish are silver-colored fingerlings, the bigger fish will not pursue a blaze-orange minnow or red and white diving bait. Those flashy colors might attract fishermen but not fish. This kit uses mostly natural-looking colors that somewhat match the local bait fish in my area so these work.<br /><br />Price-wise, these are reasonable.<br /><br />Looking these over I have not found any cracked bodies, loose connector loops, bent hooks or loops or any other problems that would compromise these. It will take more time to really know how well these will hold up with use, but all indicators so far are that these are made well and will last.<br /><br />So far I have no complaints with this set of lures. They shy away from bizarre colors, they seem to be made well and the price for the kit is reasonable. This is a fine starter kit for most freshwater situations, fly fishing excepted.",0.9258,492,30.75,0.3,2.36774
"Fishing is something I have enjoyed since I was very young and one of my very first reels was a spincasting Zebco 33 reel. It’s over 40 years old and it still works and I still use it, though my preference has shifted to spinning reels most of the time. This new Zebco 33 is similar in design and it works just as well (actually it’s so much newer so it works a lot more smoothly). So far I am very pleased with it.<br /><br />One of the things I have appreciated about spincasting reels is their ease of use without sacrificing function. They’re easy to use, easy to understand and they do every bit as good at bringing in fish as any other type of reel. They’re a great compromise between a baitcasting reel and a spinning reel – they have the accuracy of a baitcasting reel and they do not backlash, and they’re smooth like spinning reels most of the time. This reel reflects both of those attributes.  The downside I have noticed with this reel design is line memory which is especially problematic with monofilament.<br /><br />This is an attractive reel, with metal covers and a graphite base. It’s much more sturdy than plastic-based reels and should hold up well over time. The handle is oversized which is probably the nicest improvement over my old 33 as retrieves are faster.<br /><br />The drag is set via a dial on the top of the reel, about an inch from the button. It works very well and is easy to set. This is sometimes an issue with spincasting reels and Zebco got this right.<br /><br />The bite alert is basically a reverse with a loud click as the handle spins. This works when you have an unattended pole. For some people this is probably a great feature, but for me it is a feature I am very unlikely to use most of the time. I like that it’s there, though, in case I have a need for it at some point. It’s easy to turn on and off, with a simple switch on the reel’s side.<br /><br />This is the first baitcasting reel I have seen that has a reversible handle. It requires a screwdriver to switch but that’s all right – this is a great feature. I am right-handed and the reel came delivered with the handle on the right side so I don’t need to switch it, but left-handed anglers will benefit.<br /><br />Casting is very smooth as is the retrieve. So far I have had absolutely no issues with this reel. It’s pre-spooled too so the first time out requires no prep work other than threading the line through the eyes on the rod, unless you need heavier or lighter line.<br /><br />This is a solid and functional reel. It is a step up from my 40+ year-old vintage Zebco in terms of smoothness and functionality, and it will go with me instead of that old reel most of the time. It’s easy to understand and use and it’s well made. With some occasional maintenance there’s every reason to believe this reel will last for years of faithful service. I still prefer my spinning reel which is just a preference, but I will definitely be putting this reel to use all summer.",0.9922,674,28.08333333333333,0.1,2.32766
"Note: There are multiple products attached to this listing. I am specifically writing this review for the Size 60 spinning reel.<br /><br />My personal preference when it comes to choosing a type of fishing reel is a spinning reel, and I have worked with a bunch of different ones. One of the best performers I have had is another Quantum reel which I purchased on the recommendation of a tournament fisherman, and it has served me very well over the last several years. It was more expensive and is still a step up from this reel. That said, this is a decent reel in its price class and serves as a good entry-level spinner.<br /><br />I will address the one nitpick I have, and it is a minor one because of the price. This reel does not have a zero-reverse clutch which is a feature I have come to appreciate. Adding it would increase the cost though, so I can’t say this is a shortcoming. If you are used to having a zero-reverse clutch on your reels, this one will disappoint.<br /><br />Otherwise, I have no complaints. This reel casts and retrieves smoothly, it is quiet, and the drag is very easy to set and it works well. I do wish the drag were a little louder but that’s a personal preference.<br /><br />I recommend using some thought when choosing a reel size. The 60 is a bit of a brute for fresh water, though I have the hands of a gorilla so it fits me very well. It is suitable for chasing larger fish like muskellunge or striped bass, though it works well enough for smaller panfish too.<br /><br />I like this reel and it will see some heavy use this summer. It works smoothly and it seems to be designed well. It is not the most advanced reel available, even by Quantum, but it is a good entry-level reel at a good price.",0.9885,392,28.0,0.1,2.3265499999999997
"Note: There are multiple products attached to this listing. I am specifically writing this review for the Size 85 spinning reel.<br /><br />One of my favorite pastimes is fishing, and my brothers and I have made a point of scheduling an annual gathering to go fishing. Usually, that means a saltwater trip, and when we have not rented a charter we have had to provide our own gear. I do have a large saltwater reel that has served me reasonably well but it is not particularly good (I’d call it sufficient). My experience with Quantum has been freshwater spinning reels, so I know it’s a decent brand but I hadn’t worked with their saltwater-ready reels at all before this one. This is a brute of a reel and is a smooth operator, though I have encountered what I consider to be a serious issue.<br /><br />Please note, there are several different sizes of this reel. If you are looking to do freshwater fishing in a quiet pond or lake, the 85 is a beast that is probably more reel than you need. Consider one of the other choices. However, for going after saltwater fish, either from a pier or from the shore, this is a good choice if you expect to catch anything of good size.<br /><br />This reel is solid and has a smooth retrieve and zero-reverse clutch that doesn’t give even a little bit. The drag is easy to set and seems to work very well, though I do wish it was a bit louder.<br /><br />I’ve encountered on issue with this reel and I think I have a defective one. The bail does not close by itself when I start cranking, I have to manually flip it myself to lock it back into retrieve mode. I cannot tell if I have a bad unit or if this is a design decision. Regardless, it is different and unexpected behavior than I have had with every other spinning reel, whether saltwater or freshwater. I plan to reach out to Quantum to determine if this is right or not. Though it doesn’t render the reel unusable, it does make it more work than it needs to be.<br /><br />I like this reel, but I hesitate to rate it higher because of the bail issue I am seeing. Once I contact Quantum and determine the reason, I will return here and provide an update. If the bail closed as expected, this would be an easy 5-star product.",0.9408,502,29.529411764705884,0.0,1.4822400000000002
"Most people struggle to drink enough water every day, myself included. I can drink enough but the issue for me personally is that I need to be reminded or I have to have the  water bottle in front of me so I actively think about it. This is a decent water bottle that holds a gallon; it’s a little gimmicky, but it does work for me.<br /><br />The idea here is simple. It is a big water bottle that has targets marked on it for water consumption throughout the day, and if followed exactly you can guzzle a gallon of water in 14 hours. It’s really not hard. In addition to being well-hydrated the flush reduces toxins and cleans the blood.<br /><br />Now, all that said, it is no more efficient than having a pitcher of water close by and a Solo cup. It is more portable (as portable as a gallon of water can be), and the pop-up straw makes drinking from it simple. And the markings are good reminders. The current asking price (about $21 as I write this) seems a little high to me, though.<br /><br />This is a good water bottle, if a little unwieldy and somewhat pricey. It is a good option if you need to drink more and find the markings motivation enough. For me, the markings don’t help much, but the size and the fact that it’s sitting in front of me is sufficient.",0.9469,297,27.0,0.0,1.8840700000000001
"I selected this multi-tool with the intent of replacing several smaller tools in my tool bag. My bag has gotten a little overloaded and this would be a good option for reducing some of the bag clutter in favor of a more compact and versatile single unit. It's an interesting tool with some good features, but it's not quite what I was hoping for. This is a case of failed expectations more than anything.<br /><br />Though it looks very much like a pocket knife, it is a full multi-tool. The design is quite different than any other similar tool I have seen or used as it does not emphasize the pliers. As a result, it is smaller and more compact than most multi-tools. That's a plus out of the gate.<br /><br />I could go through the list of all the features it has, but those are spelled out in the product description and would serve only to waste time and space. Instead, I will focus on the specifics that I think are worth mentioning.<br /><br />Like most multi-tools, this one does not have a spring-assisted swing-out blade, though it does lock nicely. This means you have to pull it out and manually snap it in place to lock it. If you're used to having a spring assist, this will be a disappointment, though it should not be a surprise if you've worked with other multi-tools. Also no surprise - there is no safety stop at the base of the blade, so be careful when cutting.<br /><br />The pliers are workable but are thin and awkward. The folding handle is thin while the other handle is the case of the tool, and as a result the pliers are somewhat unbalanced in the hand and a little awkward to use when you first work with them. The idea behind a multi-tool is convenience and not to be the primary tool, so this is forgiveable.<br /><br />The bits that come with the tool set this unit apart from any other I have used. Instead of one or two swing-out drivers, this one instead has a single post and a set of bits that can be changed. This gives a tremendous amount of flexibility. There's just one problem - the post does not lock in place and can fold in on you while in use. This represents the one real complaint I have with the tool as a whole - locking the post would have been an easy feature to implement and woul dhave made the tool a lot safer. Please use some caution when working with the bits.<br /><br />This is not a bad tool at all, but it is not perfect. It is designed for convenience and it does work well. My main concerns are safety-related, and even so one should keep in mind that this is a convenience tool, not one on which you should rely every day. If you're looking for a multi-tool, this is a reasonable choice that's worth a look.",0.9656,590,28.09523809523809,0.1,1.91968
"I selected this luminous key ring as an aid to attaching to my camera bag and being visible at night. I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect and I had some serious doubts about the effectiveness of this product. It turns out that it’s better than I had hoped and it works well.<br /><br />The concept is very simple: expose it to bright light for a little while and it will glow in the dark for a longer while. The claim is that it will glow for up to 10 hours; I have not verified that it will last that long, but it does go for a long time, long enough in most situations that it will continue to glow long after sunset. This is really all I can ask.<br /><br />The vial appears to be filled with some sort of phosphorous-coated granules. As a first test I exposed them to the bright light of an LED flashlight for about 30 seconds, and the vial glowed for several minutes afterward. It wasn’t all that bright, but I didn’t give it long to “charge” either. It was enough as a proof of concept though. It lasts longer under extended exposure to bright light such as direct sunlight.<br /><br />The extra clips that come with the vial are useful for attaching it to other things without using the ring. One of the attachments is actually the same thing as a pen clip, which is useful for clipping to a tent flap, umbrella or other fabric surface.<br /><br />Especially when considering the cost, this is really an easy product to recommend if you need a luminous marker. It really does work for a long while, it’s very easy to see and it is versatile.",0.9894,352,32.0,0.0,2.29682
"Cornhole is a fun game that brings back memories of “Toss-Across” for me. I never had heard of, or played, cornhole until it was introduced to me at a social gathering relatively recently. I have wanted my own set for taking to family functions and picnics with friends, and this set is well suited for these situations.<br /><br />I will start with this: I received the tailgate version which is a little smaller than the regulation size set. The difference is that the boards are a foot shorter. That’s ok, but it does mean that my set is not suitable for true tournament play and instead is geared for casual competition. Both sized sets are available here; make sure you get the size you want. While it may be a little smaller, it has two distinct advantages. First, it is lighter so it is easier to carry. Second, because it is smaller it is more compact and can be stored (and transported) more easily too.<br /><br />This set is made to be portable. Most sets I have seen have been made of plywood and have fixed legs. To move them is awkward and often unwieldy. This set instead has an aluminum frame and lightweight boards so the weight is substantially reduced. The legs fold under, allowing the set to lay flat. This makes it a lot easier to pack the set for travel and to store it away when not in use. An important detail – when the legs are down they lock in place with a metal bracket so the board will not collapse.<br /><br />The set comes with 8 bean bags, 4 blue and 4 red. These are regulation size and are interchangeable with other sets.<br /><br />So far my family is very pleased with this set. It is made very well, it is compact and portable, and because this set (in my case) is the tailgate version it is lighter and easier to store when not in use. This is an easy product to recommend.",0.9924,405,22.5,0.3,2.38772
"I have a college-age son and I selected this scooter with him in mind. My thinking is that it would make getting across campus a lot easier while adding a fun factor. It has proven to be a good choice for us so far.<br /><br />This is a relatively lightweight and easy to transport scooter. Even without folding it up I can easily pick it up and move it with one hand by grasping it around the handle shaft. The weight is somewhat deceptive as it feels to be made fairly solidly and should be able to handle a bit of rough handling such as shifting in the cargo bed of a truck. There are enough other negative complaints about the build quality that we’re in a “wait and see” mode of thinking. I will revise my review if an issue surfaces.<br /><br />The motor is in the front wheel and it has enough torque to move the scooter (with me on it) up the driveway though because I am a bit on the heavier side it does struggle. On a flat, smooth surface it is at home and it does a good job getting up to “cruising” speed.<br /><br />One thing about that scooter that makes me ponder is the somewhat low maximum speed. My other son has an electric scooter that has a modestly higher maximum speed and a much farther range per charge. I am not sure if this is because of a more powerful motor, different gearing that make the Segway more capable on inclines, if the battery is more capable, or if there’s another factor that limits the speed. Regardless, it is important to keep in mind that this is not the fastest electric scooter out there, and if you want one that will get you where you’re going in the least amount of time or will travel the farthest on a single charge, this isn’t the one.<br /><br />Both the power to the motor and the braking mechanism are controlled via thumb paddles and this took a little bit of getting used to – I expected a squeeze handle for the brakes, though the paddle for the motor was expected. Using a paddle for the brakes is actually a smart move – with a squeeze brake it is all too easy to stop suddenly and end up on your back with the scooter on top of you. The brake on this scooter stops you quickly but not abruptly, so you do not lose stability.<br /><br />Interestingly, this scooter comes with digital controls and Bluetooth connectivity. The display is bright easy to read and it shows you your speed as well as power mode and battery remaining. In order to get the most out of this scooter, you have to connect it to a Bluetooth device like your phone or a tablet, and this is a two-edged sword. On one hand, it limits the speed significantly and prevents the user for using all of the functions until you connect, but on the other it establishes ownership of the scooter. I don’t particularly like having to pair it to use it – it’s a scooter, not a computing device or a set of headphones.<br /><br />So far we have had a positive experience with this scooter and my son is happy with it. Time will tell how long it lasts but initial indicators are good. It would be nice if we didn’t have to connect it to Bluetooth just to unlock features, though.",0.9955,684,36.0,0.0,1.8986500000000002
"I have been using a Brita squeeze bottle for a couple of years and it has been great when on trips. I definitely have saved money by replacing filters instead of plastic water bottles. I was interested in using this hard bottle from Brita, as using a straw-type nozzle is a lot easier than using a bottle you have to squeeze. The bottle is good and it’s designed well, But, there’s one glaring issue with this bottle.<br /><br />This is a hard bottle that is resistant to drops and scratches, and will bounce when dropped from sufficient height without breaking.<br /><br />I like the fact that the cap pops up to reveal a silicone straw, and the bottle has an insert in it that allows the drinker to pull up water from the bottom without  inverting the bottle. This is a nice change from how the squeeze bottle is used, which must be inverted. Flow is easy too – the water comes out with little effort.<br /><br />So, Brita left out one very important detail. The filters for these bottles are a charcoal cylinder through which water is forced, and it is normal to get charcoal dust out of the filter when it’s flushed before first use. So, when using the squeeze bottles, Brita says to flush the filter by filling the bottle and forcing the water through, discarding that first bottle full. This bottle cannot be squeezed, and there are no instructions in the package on how to flush the filter for use with it. Following the instructions with the product description, I flushed the filter under running water for 15 seconds. I then put the filter in my squeeze bottle, and when I forced the water through it initially came out purple-ish black as expected. After it was flushed, there was no more charcoal dust and it was ready for this bottle. Is the user expected to flush the filter by spitting out that first bottle full? I hope not, but without instructions saying otherwise there’s little alternative. The charcoal is not dangerous, of course, but it’s very unappetizing.<br /><br />This is actually a great bottle and Brita did a good job with it. The issue is with the lack of ability to flush the filter to clear out the charcoal dust. There either needs to be a better instruction set to explain, or there needs to be a tool in the box for properly flushing the filter. If Brita can resolve this problem, this would be a very easy recommend; as it stands, I have reservations about that unless there’s a way to flush the filter without relying on another bottle to do it.",0.9917,528,29.33333333333333,0.6,1.67751
"I selected this bag to replace my laptop bag, which was taken by my college-age son when his previous bag failed him. My personal preference in bags is actually a messenger style bag, not a tote, so I wasn’t sure if this would be my new go-to bag or if I needed to keep shopping. It has proven to be a good bag and I am mostly happy with it.<br /><br />This bag is large enough to handle a 15” laptop, but it is better suited for a smaller-sized laptop or tablet. It isn’t going to handle anything bigger, the limiting dimension being the height, unless you’re content with not zipping the bag or having the contents obstruct the handles. Of course there is room to put others things in the bag with said laptop too, so it’s not just a laptop sleeve.<br /><br /> The bag itself is made of a tight nylon weave with vinyl handles, a vinyl divider and an outside vinyl pocket. It is not impervious to cuts and nicks but the nylon is fine enough that it should resist most hazards such as desk corners. I looked this bag over very carefully and found no cuts, nicks or blemishes in the materials, the stitching is straight and there are no loose threads. Overall, it is made well.<br /><br />If I could change two things...I would have used canvas instead of nylon which holds up better to frequent use and tends to be stronger. Time will tell if this bag will withstand steady use, but so far it’s faring well enough and showing no signs of fatigue. Also, I would have reinforced the bottom with a heavier material which is the one place where this bag seems most likely to eventually fail.<br /><br />My preference in bags is still a messenger bag; that said, this is a decent bag that seems to be made well and is large enough to handle my laptop. If you prefer a tote bag to either a messenger or backpack, this one is worth consideration.",0.9803,411,37.36363636363637,0.1,1.92409
"I like bocce and I was thrilled to have the opportunity to review this set. I was particularly interested in this set because it is marketed as a “professional” set. As a casual bocce set this is great, but as a professional set it’s out of specifications, by more than a little. Since it is priced as a professional set, it misses the mark, though it is fine for casual and family play.<br /><br />I decided to do a little digging to see what would designate a bocce set as a “professional” set. According to the Bocce Standards Association (yes, seriously), each ball should be a specific size and weight. Of interest is the weight range: 920g +/- 10g (2 lbs.). That’s a tight range of weights, though for sporting equipment used in professional or tournament play that’s not unusual. I measured all 8 balls on a calibrated scale, set to measure in grams. The lightest ball in my set is 947g, and the heaviest is 1026g (2.25 lbs.). Every single ball is outside of the range. I could see being a little outside of the range, but over 100g is way off. Since the spread between the highest and lowest in my set is about 80g, and the specifications allow for a 20g spread between the extremes, this is not a scale problem. Most players wouldn’t even notice, but that’s not the point.<br /><br />As a casual set, this is a fine bocce set and should last for years. The balls are solid and made of some form of resin, are consistent in appearance and though do get surface scratches during play and transport (very normal), they’re rugged and should not break, crack or chip unless abused or purposely damaged. The set comes in a nylon carry bag and includes a rule book.<br /><br />This is a nice casual set, not a professional set. The balls are out of spec which makes it unsuitable for true tournament play. And as a casual set, it’s a bit expensive.",0.985,422,24.94117647058824,2.5,2.2455000000000003
"I have worked with other smart watches that monitor health. I have also worked with other Nokia products in the past. Because of my past experiences with Nokia, I had high expectations for this watch. So far, I have not been disappointed with it.<br /><br />I will start by saying this - this is a sleek, streamlined and clean-looking watch that is very aesthetically pleasant. It is very uncluttered and it simple and straightforward to read. I like that and am pleased with the overall presentation. Some smart watches, and in particular health monitor ones, are very cluttered and busy-looking, but this one keeps the display very conservative and clean. The numbers are on the outside border of the face which makes it a little tougher to read the current time but this is a minor point and contributes to the clean face.<br /><br />The charger is a little better than average and I like it. Some watches I have used have a simple magnetic disk with no pins or contacts, just a wireless solution that easily slides off. I have not had that issue with this watch so far.<br /><br />To get the most from this watch you need to download an app from either Apple or Google. The app gives access to the various functions on the watch and allows you to monitor and track progress. In playing with the iOS version, it seems to be a bit more complete and useful than a lot of other monitoring apps I have seen and used,<br /><br />Setup takes a little time. After downloading the app, the app assisted in pairing the watch ot my phone, then it sent a updates to it. The while process was 10-15 minutes, mostly painless but taking some time.<br /><br />There are a lot of functions this watch/app provides. The most obvious is a heart rate monitor, but it also is able to monitor steps, sleep cycles and more. Being a poor sleeper who wakes up repeatedly in the night, I am most interested in the sleep tracker which is a tool I have not had access to in other watches, I am still learning how to use it, but it’s working for me so far.<br /><br />Now, all that said, I had some trouble getting it to read my heart rate accurately. My resting heart rate is usually around 80 bpm. The monitor said I was averaging below 70 bpm. The only way I was able to get it to read my heart rate accurately was to flip the watch around so that the sensor touched the palm-side of my wrist. That’s ok as it is a work-around that allows the unit to work more accurately for me, but it is an unnatural way for me to wear a watch.<br /><br />The band is a downside for me - I am not a fan of rubber wrist bands. It is designed for the physically active person, not someone who putters around an office all day, so this is a case of the band not matching my day-to-day use. The band pulls a bit and is uncomfortable. When I have the chance I likely will replace it with something more comfortable. On the plus side, the band is big enough to fit an elephant, so I have no issues getting it to clasp with room to spare.<br /><br />Another concern for me is the size of the watch itself. I personally prefer a larger watch, and this one is smaller. Again, for active people or for people with smaller wrists this is much more preferable. This is not a problem with the watch, it’s my personal preferences.<br /><br />The battery is a huge plus. It lasts weeks, not hours or days, so when traveling you do not need to take your charger with you unless you’re going to be gone a month or more. Keep this in mind.<br /><br />So far I haven’t had any real problems with the watch other than having to adjust how I wear it and personal preference issues. It seems to be very capable, it has a lot of features and the software is very straightforward and easy to understand.",0.9978,841,28.03333333333333,0.1,1.92934
"I will confess that I am not a football fan and I am not a Florida Gators fan. However, my boss at work is very much both, and I selected this football for review as something I could put in the office to go with all of the other Gators swag in there (he even has a box of Gators cereal that is who knows how old). I was very pleasantly surprised by this football - it is better made than I expected.<br /><br />I will start by saying that this is a junior sized football, not the full sized. Just keep this in mind.<br /><br />In terms of being a football, this really is an unremarkable ball when it comes to assembly. It does not distinguish itself as good or bad which is fine. The stitching is tight and the ball seems to be uniform with no bulges or flat spots.<br /><br />What surprises me about this ball, though, is the way the team-specific stuff is pressed on. This isn’t just a painted football, but the team name as well as the logo (mascot) is pressed on and then painted with good quality paint. So, this isn’t just going to rub off to the point that this becomes a plain, uninteresting football but instead should retain its markings for a long time. I would suggest not leaving it in the sun where it can bleach or leaving it outside all the time where it can be exposed to inclement weather, but it should hold up fine against regular play. And as office decor, it does great.<br /><br />For novelty team swag, this is a great football that should retain the team markings for a very long time as long as the ball is not abused. It’s made well and should please any diehard fan looking to show some team spirit.",0.9872,372,33.81818181818182,0.1,2.32616
"A good utility knife is always a good thing to have when out and about and I almost always have some kind of knife with me. I use one all the time in everyday tasks, from cutting cables to trimming wires to edging plastic. I had hoped that this would be a good knife and would be a good addition for the next outdoor excursion. I was wrong. The potential is there for this knife but there are a couple of serious shortcomings that make is very hard for me to recommend.<br /><br />I will get right to my main complaints: there is no safety stop lip at the base of the blade so if your hand slips off the handle, there’s nothing to stop it from slipping onto the blade and you’re going to slice your hand. And, the handle is hard plastic and very thin, making it very slippery, especially when wet. From a safety issue alone, this knife is not good.<br /><br />In addition, the sheath allows for attaching the knife to your belt, but it allows the handle to stick up completely over the belt so the handle is continually poking me in the side.<br /><br />On the plus side, this knife is wicked sharp, it seems to be well made, it has a serrated edge for sawing, it has a built-in bottle opener and it can be used to break glass in an emergency.<br /><br />All is not lost on this knife though the positives are outweighed by the negatives. This knife presents an easy path to cutting yourself even if you’re being somewhat careful, and that’s no good. A small tab just at the base of the blade would have been sufficient to rate this knife higher.",0.9439,352,39.11111111111112,0.2,1.14317
"I work in an office where I do a lot of sitting. I do have a workbench, and I decided recently to relocate to the workbench so I could be closer to the work I need to do. The bench is high enough that it is comparable to a standing desk, so I thought this balance board would be a good help for me while I am working. It turned out a little better than I had hoped.<br /><br />At a glance this looks like a miniature surf board. It is elongated and it has a couple of soft grips for your feet on the ends. On the underside, instead of being shaped like a ridge the bottom comes to a low, rounded point in the middle. It’s a simple and effective design.<br /><br />First off, I like the soft cushions for the feet. They help with fatigue and they also make it easier to stay on the board (anyone who is as clumsy as I am knows what I mean). The cushions are foam rubber and while they make standing on them with your shoes on much more comfortable, they are soft enough to make standing on them with bare feet or in socks just as comfortable.<br /><br />The shape makes balancing and exercising easy and comfortable. You can rock back and forth, side to side or any combination in between, even wobbling in a small, slow circle. This definitely requires a bit of getting used to at first (and that should be obvious) but one used to working with it it does not take long to start feeling additional strengthening in your ankles and some in your knees. The first day I worked with it I had some mild soreness but it it went away quickly. I can see some definite benefit with physical therapy as well, if you are working on balance issues or low-impact strengthening of your legs.<br /><br />I am a big, heavy fellow, and I was concerned that this balance board would have trouble with my weight. It has proven to be able to handle me without too much trouble.<br /><br />A balance board is a useful tool when you work with a standing desk. It is a good way to get a little low-impact exercise and it is actually good for a fidgeter like me to help with focus. It’s made well, holds up to my weight, it comfortable to use and is versatile in that it allows 360 degrees of motion on a plane. It’s not especially expensive either. I have no problem recommending this balance board, whether you need it for working at a standing desk or if you are working on light physical therapy.",0.9959,532,29.55555555555556,1.8,2.8387700000000002
"[[VIDEOID:fdb4235f3eadd013641a9a7f0b748853]] I sometimes will treat myself to hot tea in the afternoons when I am working in the office. I like tea bottles over cups as I am a lot less likely to spill tea in a bottle versus a cup, so I have several that I keep on my desk. I was interested in trying this tea bottle, and it has worked out well for me so far.<br /><br />One thing that is different about this bottle is the screen. The screen is located at the bottom of the bottle, not at the top. It also is bigger than most, being slightly larger than a 35mm film tube. The holes in it are small enough to keep larger particles form getting the tea but they are not small enough to keep something like fine tea leaves (or regular ground coffee) out.<br /><br />The bottle is borosilicate glass and is single layer. So, to compensate for the lack of insulation the bottle comes with a sleeve that keeps you from burning your hand and also helps to keep the contents of the bottle hot (or cold, as appropriate). The sleeve is easy to put on and take off.<br /><br />The bottle comes with two bottle brushes and a handle for those brushes. The brushes are simply foam heads on a plastic handle but they are sufficient for properly cleaning out the bottle.<br /><br />So far this bottle has worked out well for me. I am happy with it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at minimal or no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",0.9855,359,32.63636363636363,0.3,2.38565
"I love to fish, especially when I am with my two sons who make perfect fishing buddies. One of them has taken to spinning reels, while the other prefers another type. So, with two of us in the family favoring spinning reels I was eager to try this reel to see how well it would hold up and perform for me. I have only one issue with it, relating to the spool, but in operation this is a very smooth and well-designed spinning reel.<br /><br />This is a smaller reel than what I normally use though this is not a problem for me. Instead of large bass, this reel works for me when I am after sunfish and perch. In spite of the small size, even in my big hands the bail does not scrape my knuckles as it spins. This is a plus for me as I have had this problem with smaller reels.<br /><br />I have two pet peeves with spinning reels that come up time and again. First, if the bail does not pass over the spindle far enough the line does not come off the spool very easily and it greatly reduces the casting distance, even more so than will a cheap rod with sub-par eyelets. This is not a problem with this reel and I have been able to get good casting distance with lightweight test.<br /><br />The other issue I have with reels that many fail to implement properly is a zero-reverse clutch. When engaged, there should be absolutely no play at all in the reel and there should be absolutely no reverse turning – period. A good number of reels allow a small amount of reverse in the turn which is unacceptable. This one gets it right and when the clutch is engaged there is no reverse at all.<br /><br />Many reels I have used have 9 or 10 ball bearings. This one has 12. Generally speaking, more ball bearings means smoother operation and returns. This is definitely a very smooth reel, arguably the smoothest reel I have ever used.<br /><br />There is one negative about this reel that merits mention. The spool is attractive and it has 14 diagonal openings that allow air flow and add to the appearance. These have very sharp ridges that you can feel when you run a finger across them and they are sharp enough that you can cleanly trim a fingernail on them. Normally this is not something I would really mind, except that in the event of a severe backlash you can nick or cut your line which is a more serious issue. If I can find a different spool that will fit I plan to replace it which would make this reel just about perfect.<br /><br />This is a nice, smaller reel. It gets the important things right – the bail flips properly and the zero-reverse clutch is excellent. It is very smooth too. The spool is the only issue and even then one might argue that I am being picky but it still merits mention. This reel will see more use as we get deeper into the summer.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"This is my first exposure to a spotting scope, and my initial impressions are positive. I was unsure of what to expect but so far this scope has proven to be useful. I took it with me to the office to get the opinions of some of my coworkers who have worked with these a little more and know what to look for.<br /><br />This is a small scope on a mounting bracket. It is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand and it is very lightweight and as such it does not weigh down whatever to which you have attached it. This was a pleasant surprise right out of the box.<br /><br />The lens is large enough that it is easy to see through it without the need to squint or peer through with one eye close to it and the other closed.<br /><br />What makes this site interesting is that it does have a laser target built in but it does not project to the target. Rather, it appears on the lens and illuminates it on the lens so it cannot be seen from a distance. The size and shape are adjustable so it is easy to get the scope set up to illuminate the target as you prefer.<br /><br />There are two colors for the laser, red and green, and there are multiple settings for the brightness. Paired with the size/shape adjustment, you can set this up to illuminate exactly the way you want with little trouble.<br /><br />In the box is a CR2032 battery that is used to power the laser itself. I was a little surprised when I took it out as the battery was already opened. I assume it was tested, as I put it on a meter and it was very fresh and ready to go.<br /><br />I am still learning how to work with this scope but my initial impressions are good. It is easy to use, it is lightweight and it has several features that make it easy to set just right.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"An umbrella is usually one of those things you don’t think about until you need it, and at that point it is often too late to go get one without getting soaking wet. I am in the habit of keeping one in the back seat of my car so I will always have one when I am out and about. The one I keep there has been great but it is nothing particularly special (excepting the color). I was anxious to see if this umbrella would be better for my needs. So far it has worked out well for me.<br /><br />This is a very large and sturdy umbrella, which is the kind I prefer (I am ok with the little compact ones in a pinch, when I am just trying to keep my head dry). It opens with the push of a button and it snaps open with a loud click, so there is no question it is completely open. Closing again requires two hands, one to hold the handle and the other to pull down the slider to snap it in place, and when it is closed properly it does so with a loud click – again, no question that it is closed properly.<br /><br />It appears to be very study when open. I have had it get caught in a strong gust and it did not invert on me, which is a very good thing. The handle is solid and is well insulated with a foam grip that is easy to  hang onto even when very wet.<br /><br />One of the features about this umbrella that is prominently placed in the description as well as on the packaging is that it is coated in Teflon. I will confess that I cannot see or feel it on the nylon, but water does bead up and roll off differently than with other umbrellas I have used. This may not seem like it’s all that important – until you are ready to shake it dry and close it. Most nylon umbrellas I have used do not shake dry so nicely, but this one is a little better about that than most.<br /><br />Finally, the umbrella itself comes in a nice sleeve that serves two purposes. First, it protects the umbrella when it is not in use which is a minor concern but is helpful in some situations like storage in a full closet. The other purpose it has is for carrying – it has a double cord in it so it can be slung over a shoulder, or work like a backpack when closed. This frees up your hands of other things when it is not raining.<br /><br />This is a nice, large and well-made umbrella. It is constructed to handle windier conditions and it repels water a bit better than most. It is a little more expensive than the typical umbrella, but it is worth it’s asking price and I am happy to recommend it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"Before receiving this camera for review I was unfamiliar with hunting cameras. I was interested in trying it to see what creatures come to the bird feeders after dark. I know foxes used to come and I have seen racoons and other small animals so I was anxious to try this and see if it could capture the action after dark for me (which would save me having to get up in the night or stand watch). It works fairly well, though it eats batteries quickly.<br /><br />This is a fairly large camera, a little bigger than my digital camera but a different shape. The front is colored in camouflage to make it blend in with the surroundings for which it is intended. The whole unit is solid and is sealed nicely to keep out moisture, with a rubber gasket between the halves of the shell.<br /><br />There is a hinged door on the front of the camera that opens to reveal all of the controls, interfaces and a miniature screen. There are a number of buttons to access the camera’s features through a straightforward menu system. I found no manual in the box so there is little guidance. There is a CD in the box and I suppose the manual may be on there. Regardless, I found the menu system to be straightforward and easy to understand once I got into it.<br /><br />Options that can be set through the menu system include picture and video resolution, time/date, lat/long, length of video recordings, timer settings and a lot more. There are six pages of settings, all of which are fairly self explanatory.<br /><br />There are slots for a standard-sized SD card and also for a micro-SD card. Be aware that neither of these are included in the package and you will need to supply one on your own. The size you need will depend on the resolution you set for pictures and video. There is a USB port and video out port as well (with a connector) so the video can be fed to another source for playback.<br /><br />The camera takes 8 AA batteries. I discovered that the unit complains when using NiMH batteries that are fully charged, citing “low batteries”. The problem goes away with fresh, fully charged alkalines. The different in voltage is enough to make the camera complain. More of a concern, though, is that the camera draws on the batteries quickly and can run them down fast. This is ok if you check on it often (daily). The camera also can accept a 12V barrel plug adapter but this kills portability.<br /><br />The might images I took with this camera are a little on the dark end but are clear enough to see what’s under my feeders. Unfortunately, the foxes appear to be gone.<br /><br />This is a neat little camera. It works well and it is waterproof. It has some night vision capabilities and it is adjustible to suit your needs in terms of resolution and card size. It could use some more documentation, though, and it does burn through batteries, but otherwise it is a good camera.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"I have worked with several KaskKing reels and so far I have had good results with them, particularly the Orcas spinning reel. I like how they work, I like how they look and they are affordable which is a bonus. I was given the opportunity to try the Sharky II spinning reel and so far it has demonstrated itself to be a good reel. Because the weather has been uncooperative for fishing of late (too cold) I have been practicing casts with a casting plug, to get a feel for how well it works.<br /><br />I selected the 5000 model as it is the best fit for my needs.<br /><br />This is a very attractive spinning reel, with red, black and chrome. Unlike every other reel I have used, the bail is actually painted red which is an interesting accent. When reeling the retrieve is very smooth, but more noticeable to me is the fact that the reel is nearly silent in operation. It does make a slight bit of noise, but you have to listen closely for it and it is appreciably less noise than many other reels I have used. This is an important feature to me.<br /><br />One of the things I look for in a spinning reel is a zero-reverse clutch, and this one has an excellent one. When engaged, the forward spin is smooth as can be, but when you try to reel in reverse there is absolutely no back spin at all. This shows some attention to detail. I have used reels that advertise a zero-reverse clutch that have a slight bit of backspin which is unacceptable. I am glad this one is made correctly.<br /><br />Casting is obviously important with this type of reel and I have paid attention to how this one works when casting. The bail is shaped correctly – wide enough around the spindle – to keep from interfering with casting. It is not so wide as to scrape your knuckles when reeling which is excellent (if you ever have a reel that does that, scrap it). The line peels off this reel effortlessly and I have been able to get very good distance out of it.<br /><br />The drag set works as designed and I like the fact that it does not get difficult to tighten until very close to the maximum. I don’t mind having to put in a little effort to tighten the drag, but having it remain easy to operate is a certainly a good thing.<br /><br />For its size this is a relatively lightweight reel.<br /><br />So far I have not has any issues with this reel. It seems to be very smooth, quiet and made well. I admit that it has not been used yet for an actual fishing trip because the weather has only recently warmed up. But, I have been able to practice casting and so far it appears to be a fine reel.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"This is the first electronic whistle I have ever seen or used and I have been impressed with it so far. I was not exactly sure what to expect from it and I was curious to see how it would compare to a traditional whistle. It definitely has some advantages over a regular whistle and is very definitely worth some consideration if you officiate outdoor sports.<br /><br />This is a small and not unattractive device, about the size of a tube to toothpaste (slightly smaller) and bright yellow. It has a lanyard attached to it so it can be hund around the neck like a traditional whistle to secure to a wrist if that is preferred. One end is open and this is where the sound comes out. There’s a single button control on the side for activating the whistle, and a switch that allows for switching between two different tones and turning the whole unit off.<br /><br />The whistle takes two CR2032 batteries, included in the package. This is a relatively common battery size now so it is easy to find replacement batteries when the batteries are depleted. While AAA batteries would have made more sense to me, they would have added weight to the whistle so button batteries are a good choice.<br /><br />This is a LOUD whistle! It is a bit louder than I expected. Tone one is a traditional whistle sound and is suitable for officiating at outdoor games like soccer and football. The second tone is slightly lower and has more of a buzz two it; this tone would also work for outdoor sports, but I think it is best suited for when there are two officials and you want to differentiate between the two of them.<br /><br />I would stop short of calling this whistle waterproof but it is definitely acceptable for use outside in light rain.<br /><br />The main advantage this whistle has over a traditional whistle is the fact that it does not require any effort. You do not have to blow through it which gets tiring after a while with normal whistles. Also, because you never have to put your mouth on it, it is more sanitary.<br /><br />If you have need to use a whistle, particularly outdoors, this electronic whistle is a good choice. It is cleaner that a traditional whistle, it is at least as loud, it has two distinct sounds and is semi-waterproof.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"I have a son who is involved in basketball and has been on teams of one form or another since he was very young. This year he is on a competitive team and he has not one but two coaches that direct the team. This basketball coach's clipboard is an excellent fit for his game and is a valuable accessory for his coaches when in the middle of a game.<br /><br />This is a solid, smooth plastic clipboard that has the diagram of the court on it. It is large enough to draw out complicate plays without being unwieldy and small enough to fit in a book bag. It is fairly lightweight and easy to hold in one hand while drawing with the other.<br /><br />I have worked with other coaching clipboards and have seen some that come with a magnetic metal surface. Plastic is preferable to be honest as it is lighter and it does not show scratches as easily. The downside it that plastic is more susceptible to breaking if dropped.<br /><br />As a dry erase surface, this is a fine board. I used a black dry erase marker on it and it cleaned up without any trouble at all. It did not seem to collect any residue either, though I have not had it long enough to know for sure if it will eventually stain, so it will take some time to know.<br /><br />One thing I wish came with this clipboard would be an actual dry erase marker. This is just the board, with no marker or eraser.<br /><br />If you are coaching basketball at any level you likely will need a coaching clipboard unless you like drawing on paper or are very detailed when you speak. As a coach's clipboard this is a good one – it is easy to clean, it's lightweight and it is relatively inexpensive.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"[[VIDEOID:cae41c19a00f7dde693577c0aba651e3]] I have several camping lanterns of varying types. There is a fairly wide variety between them when it comes to brightness, features and design. This one is a bit different than the others I have used in that includes a substantial power bank. This makes this lantern a lot more useful when camping.<br /><br />This is a small and compact little lantern, about the size of a can of vegetables. It is a solid little unit, with a bit of heft from the battery pack. It casts a good bit of light and it has a couple of different modes. It can shine dim, shine bright or flash which is fairly standard with rechargeable laterns.<br /><br />What is not standard is the inclusion of a 10,400 mAh power pack. This is a little more powerful than the average pack (5,000-10,000 mAh) and it is sufficient to provide a full charge to a tablet or several charges to a cell phone. My old phone could be charged with between 2,000 and 2,500 mAh but it was a smaller phone; a big phone like a Galaxy Note will get fewer charges from the power pack.<br /><br />There is a decent hook on the top of this lantern that is well suited for clipping to a backpack or tree branches. It casts enough light to read by and it can light a fairly good-sized room sufficiently to make out colors and navigate through the room without trouble.<br /><br />The whole is sealed very well and when the flaps are in place over the USB ports this unit is very well protected from weather and water.<br /><br />This is a nice little lantern, for its size it is nice and bright and it is capable of charging a cell phone or tablet. If you plan to be camping or part of the great outdoors and need a light and a power supply for your phone rolled into one, this is a great choice.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"[[VIDEOID:7cace53d54dd11d9ca86d52ec20f0527]] If you ever go camping or if you live in an area where there are frequent power outages you understand the need for a good lantern. I have worked with several lanterns and while I have used some that are a little brighter or a little more compact, this one is a decent one that has some good features. Besides having a couple of operation modes, it is chargeable via solar energy.<br /><br />This is a reasonably bright lantern but it is not blindingly bright like some others I have seen. This is a trade-off in my book. If you are expecting something that is bright enough to light a small camp area and allow you to read by it, this is a decent lamp. If you want something to light a 20'x20' room it is not strong enough to provide color recognition through the whole room.<br /><br />This lantern has a rechargeable battery that can be removed and plugged in to the provided power adapter for recharging. It can also be opened up to expose a pair of solar panels so it can be charged up via solar power. There is something very important to understand about solar charging, though – using the solar panels to charge this lantern takes a lot longer than if plugging the pack in. I have not tried to completely charge the lantern via solar power but in my experience solar charging takes roughly 4 to 5 times longer. That said, if you do not have the option to plug in, the solar panel is a superb option.<br /><br />This lantern seems to be solidly made and resistant to easy breakage. So, I believe it would survive a drop from a short distance, though I would hesitate to test this theory. The hook loop on top is plastic but it seems sturdy enough to handle frequent use and abuse.<br /><br />This lantern has two operation modes. It has two brightnesses – dim and bright. The dim light is enough to light a hallway when carrying this lantern though it is not going to work for tromping through the woods. The bright setting is not actually all that bright but it is enough to see through a large room and make out everything in it, though it does not cast enough light to see colors clearly at more than 10' or so.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent little lantern. It seems to be made well and it can be charged by either a power adapter or solar power. Just keep in mind that it is not going to charge quickly if using the solar cells to charge it up.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"[[VIDEOID:97485467a42838457096fc5f5b521c7a]] I work in an area where a good, bright flashlight it often an absolute necessity. I like the brightness of the latest generation LED flashlights even though it can be harsh as they can really light up and area so much better than an incandescent light or cheaper LED lights. This is an exceptionally bright flashlight that works very well and is easy to adjust.<br /><br />In the package is the flashlight itself, a rechargeable 18650 battery and a battery charger. Everything you need to get going and using this light is in the box and the battery is charged up already so when you open the box you're ready to go. Also included is a holder/adapter for AAA batteries so this flashlight can be used with 3 AAA batteries instead of so desired.<br /><br />This flashlight has 5 operating modes: high brightness, medium brightness, low brightness, strobe and SOS. When the power button is pressed but not clicked all the way it changes the mode of the flashlight. Pressing it all the way in so it clicks turns the whole thing on and off. The lens can be slid back and forth to move the light between brightness on a concentrated spot and diffused over a wider coverage area.<br /><br />The flashlight is made of aluminum and it is a solid and durable unit. As a bonus, it comes with a wrist lanyard.<br /><br />This is the flashlight I carry in my toolbag to work every day. I am very pleased with it and am happy to recommend it. It is exceedingly bright, it is very adjustable and it has multiple operating modes. The icing on the cake is the inclusion of a battery and charger so you never have to be without light.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"Before working with this water bag I was unfamiliar with the concept of using a nylon bag as a way to hold water, and I struggled a bit to determine how to use this bag. As it turns out, I found a very good use for it that is similar to holding water but is a variation on a theme. In short, this makes a fantastic ice bag.<br /><br />I was a little surprised when this bag arrived as it is a little smaller than I expected. When unfolded and filled or just stood up it is a little bigger than a basketball. I had an image in my head that it would be bigger, like the size of a book bag or similar. This is not a very large bag but it does hold more than a gallon of water at a time, if you are so inclined to fill it with that much water and try to carry it.<br /><br />The whole bag is made of nylon though there are three different types used. The outer shell is a parachute nylon which makes it very strong and also water resistant. The inner lining is a microweave type that holds liquid very well and is also very lightweight. The handle is a heavier type of nylon and is strong enough to hold the bag when it is full.<br /><br />The product description says this bag will hold water so it can be transported from a source to a campsite or similar scenario. I found another good use. It is not a huge bag but it is larg enough to hold several soft drink cans and ice. So, filling this bag with ice and then putting in drink cans, you can keep a small number of cans cold and not drip water all over when the ice melts. This is a good option for when you are cooking out or you are having a small gathering and need to keep a few drinks cold without digging up a cooler.<br /><br />This is an exceptionally lightweight bag and it compacts down very small. It is small enough to fit in a large pocket when it is completely folded up and packed in the little bag in which it comes. I have not put the bag on a scale but it definitely weighs less than a pound.<br /><br />This is an interesting little bag. It is definitely waterproof and while it is marketed as a bag for carrying water it does serve some other uses too. It is small, lightweight and well-made.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"My wife and I like a good picnic and while we do not get to go as often as we would like, we go when we can and we have a good time. I have an actual picnic basket with a red and white checkerboard tarp which is ok but it is not very large and not insulated enough to provide any cushion from the ground. I looked to this blanket as a possible solution. It’s very attractive and it is very clearly a good water barrier, but it offers nothing in the way of padding or insulation.<br /><br />This is a large blanket, roughly 6'x4.5', which is quite a lot larger than others I have used. It has a very pretty blue plaid pattern and it folds up very compactly so that it is about the size of a handbag. Being so compact it can be packed up and taken anywhere, and the only thing it lacks is a handle to make it even easier to carry though not having a handle is hardly a problem.<br /><br />The back of this blanket is a hard, semi-smooth material somewhat resembling vinyl but more rugged (it is more like a grilling mat). This provides a great barrier against moisture and protects even when put on a very shallow bit of standing water (though the top will get wet not by soak-through but by submersion).<br /><br />My main complaint with this blanket is that it is so thin and lightweight that it really does not provide any insulation on hard ground. I was hopeful that it would be more like a thin layer of wool but it’s more like a sheet of material bonded to a plastic backing. That is the sacrifice made to make this so easy to compact.<br /><br />This is not a bad blanket by any means. It is a good blanket if you need something that can seat several people and it is very pretty. That said, do not expect much in the way of cushion with it. It’s a great choice if you want to sit on damp ground and if you need to pack it for a trip and are short on room.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"I live in an area about equidistant from the beach and the mountains. I like going to the beach but I much prefer the mountains, particularly in the autumn when the leaves change. One of the simple pleasures in life is having a picnic in the mountains, and this particular beach blanket is a good accessory for those trips.<br /><br />This is not a blanket in the traditional sense. There is no padding, no fiber, no fringe. This is a very thin cover made of parachute nylon and it is very lightweight and thin. It will not provide any insulation from hard ground, nor will it provide much in the way of drying off after getting wet, but it is very water resistant and it will keep you from getting wet from wet ground unless you put it down on standing water.<br /><br />Because this is such a lightweight blanket it means that it can be caught up with a good gust of wind. Provision has been made for that. There are pockets on the corners and they can be filled with sand at the beach or with stones when farther away. There are also loops on the corners for securing with pegs. Unfortunately there are no pegs included with this blanket and that is the one thing I would suggest for improvement.<br /><br />I have a special use for this blanket. Along the Blue Ridge parkway there are picnic areas and my family and I like to go there for a nice picnic lunch. The blanket makes a perfect (although very large) tablecloth for the picnic table. When we’re done, it is very easy to clean and it packs up for the next trip with little effort.<br /><br />I love the fact that this blanket compacts down to a size smaller than a football. It folds up very neatly and compactly and it fits in a pretty blue nylon bag with a pull tie. At that size it is small enough to fit in a shoulder bag or in just about any space in the car when traveling.<br /><br />This is a very well-made blanket, too. I have found no issues with the stitching, the seams are straight and there are no nicks or cuts in the nylon material. I imagine that will change over years of use, but so far it still is pristine.<br /><br />I am very happy with this beach blanket. It serves me well on picnics in the mountains, which is really all I could ask for. It is made well, it’s plenty large, and there are some thoughtful features that went into it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"I have worked with several camp lanterns and I have seen a good variance in features, strength of the output light and power source. This is a small and compact camp lantern that works well and serves well in a couple of capacities.<br /><br />This little lantern compacts down to about the size of a baseball. When expanded it stands approximately 5&#34; tall and it exposes a nylon mesh over a spring. The mesh serves as a light diffuser and it casts out a gentle but bright light when powered on. It has three operating modes - bright, very bright and flashing. The flashing mode is great for attracting attention and acts as a beacon.<br /><br />This lantern has a lens on the bottom which is close to the actual LED. When the lantern is collapsed the light coming through the lens comes out very bright and concentrated and the whole unit can be used as a flashlight. When expanded, the light instead diffuses and it casts a light glow which lights the area underneath the lantern if it is hung somewhere.<br /><br />It requires 3 AA batteries to power this lantern which do not come in the box. I am not sure how long the burn time is for this unit before the batteries are drained as I have not run it that long to find out but it should last several hours with no trouble.<br /><br />Because of the ability to use this as a flashlight, this is a good unit to keep around for emergency use. It is very lightweight, it is weather resistant and it is very bright. I am very pleased with this light.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"Camp lanterns serve a couple of useful purposes. They can help light an area when outdoors (and camping) and they can be used as an emergency light source when there is need for extra light (such as during a power outage). Battery-powered lanterns offer more convenience and do not require liquid fuels. This particular lantern is especially suited for emergencies as it has a rechargeable power supply and it also has a hand-crank for getting short bursts of emergency power when it is otherwise depleted.<br /><br />This is a small lantern that is a little smaller in diameter than a typical coaster. It is bright orange which will make it easy to find, even on a cluttered desk in the daylight. It is a collapsible unit and when collapsed (as it comes in the package) it is less than 2” thick and when expanded is about 5” tall.<br /><br />It has two brightness modes, one being somewhat bright and the other being very bright. On the bottom of this lantern is a lens that sits over the internal LED and when the lantern is expanded the lens lets through a well-diffused and gentle light that illuminates a wide area. When collapsed the light coming from the lens is much more concentrated and is bright and defined enough to serve as a flashlight.<br /><br />The power source for this lantern is an internal rechargeable battery. This can be charged with the included cable, but it is not a USB cable and instead uses a round plug. This is the one criticism I have of this lantern – don’t lose that cable. But…in addition to the cable the lantern includes a crank mechanism that can deliver some emergency power to the battery when needed, requiring a little manual effort. Unless you want to crank for a long, long time, do not expect the crank to charge this lantern up all the way or even close to it. It’s there for emergencies, not a primary charging source.<br /><br />The unit is fairly rugged and weatherproof. It is sealed up nicely and should hold up well in adverse weather like light rain. I would not try to submerge it but I suspect it would survive if dropped in water briefly.<br /><br />I like this lantern and I can see the possibilities with it. It’s a great little emergency light and it can work as a flashlight or a lantern. It’s small and it packs well. Just don’t lose the charging cable.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"I remember my father using a camp lantern on a trip to the mountains one time when I was young. It required a liquid fuel and it had a mesh wick that eventually disintegrated and needed to be replaced. That was a long time ago. Many lanterns now are much different. This one is a pop-up lantern with batteries for its fuel cells and it works very well, not just as lantern but also as an emergency flashlight when help properly.<br /><br />Out of the box this lantern comes compressed and it is small enough to be palmable (approximately 3” in diameter and 2” high). This is great for packing and it stows very easily in camping gear, a suitcase or even a fishing tackle box. When “opened” it stands about 5” tall and reveals a white mesh that covers the spring that connects the top and bottom halves of the lantern.<br /><br />The top of the lantern screws off to reveal the batter compartment. This particular lantern takes 3 AA batteries. When installed the batteries do add appreciable weight to the lantern but this is relative; even with the batteries installed the lantern still weighs less than a pound.<br /><br />There are three modes of light with this lantern – bright, brighter and flashing. The lower brightness is still bright enough to light up a small room sufficiently for navigating in the dark. Where it gets interesting is that the lantern has a small lens on the bottom and when the light is on it sends out a beam from the lens. The lens covers the internal LED so this works like a flashlight. When expanded, the lens is farther away from the LED and the result is a more diffused and dimmer circle of light under the lantern. When the lantern is collapsed, though, it creates a bright and focused circle of light that is bright enough to serve as a very bright flashlight.<br /><br />The lantern has a small loop handle so it can easily be hung by a hook or a branch.<br /><br />It came in handy recently when we had a heavy thunderstorm. This lantern was sufficient to provide light when the power went out. It was a brief outage but it was enough to demonstrate the usefulness of the light in an emergency.<br /><br />This is a nice, compact little lantern and it works well for me. It is very lightweight and it casts a lot of light. While good for camping and outdoor activity, it also works well as an emergency light source and also a very bright flashlight.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"There are a number of lighting kits available for biking. Most of the ones I have used and seen have included a tail light and sometimes a headlight, and these lights are somewhat limited in the functions they have. This kit is a little more capable than most. It still has just two lights – a headlight and a tail light – but these lights are more advanced than most and they also come with a harness for mounting the headlight on a helmet.<br /><br />I’ll talk about each component separately.<br /><br />The headlight is the most impressive component in the whole kit. It is a rechargeable light with two very bright LEDs though it is very small, maybe 2”x1.5”. It has three brightness settings and on the brightest setting it is sufficient for lighting a room. By itself it is very lightweight. The weight comes from the rechargeable battery to which it connects, and oddly enough the battery is larger than the light itself. The battery can be charged up via AC power and the adapter is included in the kit. Note that this battery cannot be charged via USB.<br /><br />The tail light is bigger and is about the size of a silver dollar. It takes two AA batteries (not included in the kit). There are two buttons on it, one for LED and one for laser light. The laser light shines a stripe of red light on the ground on either side of the bike. I have not seen this feature before and I am learning how to use it to my advantage still. The LED function is another story entirely – the light has multiple modes, including a solid-shine and several flash cycles. This tail light has more modes than any others I have seen or used. Choose the cycle that makes you most visible from behind (or distinguishes you from the rest of your group). It comes with a plastic harness to which it simply clips into place once the harness is attached to the bike frame.<br /><br />Also included in the kit is a pair of rubber straps for attaching the tail light.<br /><br />This is a very nice kit and it offers a lot of features. The tail light is impressive in the number of modes it had and the headlight is far brighter than its size would suggest. This is a great kit for the serious biker and has almost everything you might want in a kit.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"If you work out or spend any amount of time in the gym, you are familiar with the benefit of wearing weight lifting gloves. A good pair will protect your hands and prevent blisters, chafing and other stresses brought on by operating the equipment. This pair of weight gloves is very nice and is a bit better than the last pair I owned.<br /><br />These are not leather gloves at all but are made of a very lightweight, breathable material that has some stretch to it. There are areas of spandex as well which really help with fit. The palm is a reinforced area of material with a honeycomb pattern of a non-slip material, I think silicone but I am not completely sure. Though not actually leather they seem to be durable.<br /><br />One thing this set of gloves gets right where so many other glove manufacturers have failed me - they are the right size. I received a pair of XL gloves and what I got is labeled XL and they actually fit me. Usually I need to order a size or two higher to get them to fit, but these do not have that issue.<br /><br />The elastic and Velcro straps keep these gloves in place and they stay snug but not tight. I like that. The strap wraps around the wrist and attached via Velcro which is a bit easier to maneuver than using a latch-style strap to hold them in place. It also feels more secure.<br /><br />I looked these over for flaws and could not find any. The stitching is straight and even, there are no crooked pieces of material and the Velcro is tight and even. These seem to be made very well.<br /><br />I am pleased with these weight gloves.

"I selected these gloves knowing they would be a little small for me but thinking they would fit my teenage son better. As it turns out the size runs small and you really need to buy up one or two sizes to get them to fit just right.<br /><br />These are athletic gloves and are well-suited for racquet sports, football, basketball, golf and other ball sports as well as biking. They will also work for weight lifting though I would not recommend these for that purpose but instead would recommend something a bit more ruggedized. The palm and print-side fingers are made of a vinyl-like material that is not sticky but slightly tacky and makes gripping and holding very easy. The rest of the gloves are made of light, stretchy material and leatherette material which breathes really well. There is a Velcro wrist strap which tightens the grip around the wrist and keeps the gloves in place.<br /><br />There are padded sections across the knuckles and on the fingers and thumb which are great for reducing impact damage and pain if you bang your hands (playing racquetball is one situation in which this can happen). This is something I have not seen on work gloves but would appreciate.<br /><br />These seem to be made very well. I have found no loose threads, uneven seams or imperfections in the materials that would give me any pause with these gloves. I have no issues with the materials and workmanship.<br /><br />I received a pair of Adult Large gloves. I have hands like a gorilla so I knew they would not fit me very well at all. However, my son is smaller (5’5”, proportional and athletic build) and I figured they would work well for him. I asked him to put them on and try them out, and he complained that they were a bit small even for him, particularly when the Velcro strap was pulled tight. So, for him, an XL is the right size and for me XXL would be right. This is the only issue with these gloves we have found – large should have been appropriate for him, but instead they almost fit.<br /><br />These are very nice gloves and they are very well made. Just remember to buy a size or two larger than you think you need.",0.9859,459,30.6,0.0,1.8957700000000002
"I love to go freshwater fishing and this weekend I approached the lake with a brand new weapon - a KastKing Sharky 6000 spinning reel. This is a serious reel that made a good day of fishing even better.<br /><br />I will start by saying that even though it is approximately the same weight as my primary reel - a KastKing Orcas 4000 - it is significantly larger. I spooled on over 200 yards of 10-lb. test fluorocarbon line and it still had room for more line on it. I put it on an 8' limber rod and headed out to a productive spot.<br /><br />I am very fussy about my reels and I expect them to meet several criteria. I want a good cast range, a smooth cast, smooth retrieve, quiet operation and a zero-reverse clutch. There has to be enough clearance between my knuckles and the bail to keep it from rapping me on the knuckles when I retrieve. And finally, the drag has to work and be easy to set. The Sharky met every one of these requirements.<br /><br />I learned fast (and the hard way) that the reel is more than accommodating when it comes to casting and more than once I sent my lures into the trees instead of to the edge of the bank when I was unable to hit the bank with other reels on identical rods. This required a little adjustment on my part but it meant I did not have to work as hard and it also meant I could hit farther targets when I wanted to. So, when I fish from the bank I have a better range into whatever water I am fishing.<br /><br />The retrieve is glassy smooth and very fast too. Not once did I have a problem with snarled line on the retrieve when I had near-zero load which is a problem on some reels. I like that I could bring in the line very quickly when needed (like for grabbing the net to assist another fisherman). The reel is quiet when spinning - not silent, but quiet.<br /><br />When the ant-reverse clutch is engaged there is no reverse at all. To me this is a sign that the reel is quality made and is assembled well. I really, really dislike reels that do not have a zero-reverse clutch, and even worse is a reel that has one but it still has just a little play in it. The Sharky’s zero-reverse is solid and works exactly like it’s supposed to work - absolutely zero reverse.<br /><br />The bail spins an inch or so away from my knuckles but never once has it hit my hand when spinning.<br /><br />The drag set is uniform and smooth and does not really get harder to turn until close to the end of the tightening range.<br /><br />In appearance this is a very attractive reel, black and red with a little bit of chrome. It is surprisingly lightweight for the size. I have bigger hands than average so a reel this size that doesn’t add much more weight is very welcome.<br /><br />The reel helped me land a good variety of fish including largemouth bass, crappie and a near-citation yellow perch. The most exciting catch was a largemouth bass which was not huge but not small either and provided the best test of the reel under stress, and the reel brought this fish to the boat easily without incident. Even under the load of a fighting bass the reel was just as smooth in operation as when retrieving a test plug.<br /><br />I am very, very pleased with the Sharky 6000 and will be using it again in the same lake in a few weeks. It has not let me down even once and it works very well. If you want a larger reel that works great and does not add a lot of weight to your gear, take a very close look at this reel.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"For runners and cyclists who like to exercise at night or in the early morning hours, reflective safety harnesses are a must. I had not considered reflective ankle and wrist bands before these, and so far I am happy with them.<br /><br />Like the vests by the same company, these are a bright shade of neon greenish-yellow, a color that is very hard to miss when light hits it. They are painted with a pair of silvery metallic paint stripes which almost look self-lit when they catch and reflect light. These are designed for night visibility and they are excellent for this purpose.<br /><br />These are attached by way of a 2&#34;x2&#34; square of velcro that is the same bright color. The elastic stretches so that they can be attached without too much trouble even on larger limbs. I was able to attach them to the thick part of my calf but not to the upper part of my thigh - this is unrealistic placement but it gave me a good idea of how much these will stretch to accommodate. With two pairs in the package, if necessary they can all be attached together to make a waist band.<br /><br />These are well made and should last for a long time. The elastic and velcro are of good quality and seem to be stitched together well. More importantly, the paint stripes do not rip or crack when the elastic is pulled tight which is the one concern I had. Because the paint also stretches, it should not peel which is a very good thing.<br /><br />These are fine elastic reflective bands that should last for a long time and definitely increase visibility at night. Consider these if you need a reflective solution for nighttime running or cycling.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",0.9933,407,33.916666666666664,0.5,2.44799
"Many people like to run at night or in the very early morning hours and one of the necessary pieces of equipment for these people is a reflective harness-style vest that makes them more visible to traffic. Most vests I have seen and used have been smaller, lighter or made of cheaper materials. These vests by Apace Vision are superior to those and are a quality product.<br /><br />First, these vests are a bright shade of neon greenish-yellow, a color that is very hard to miss when light hits it. They are wide too, about 2&#34; across the bands. Each band has two reflective stripes of silvery metallic paint that catch the light very well and make it very difficult to miss when illuminated.<br /><br />Aside from the visibility aspect, these are definitely of higher quality than many other vests and harnesses I have seen and used. The bands are made of good-quality elastic that stretches easily without strain yet holds tight. The buckle is a very substantial clasp that snaps together with a loud click so you know it is fastened and when clasped it does not pull open unintentionally. I tried to pull it - hard - and it did not give even a little. For a running vest this might be a little overkill but it is not at all unwelcome. The bands can be adjusted too so a larger or smaller person can use these without too much trouble. Right out of the package these fit me without any adjustments, though loosening them probably would make them fit better. When the elastic bands are pulled, the paint stretches with them but does not fracture, rip or crack so it is a lot less likely to peel.<br /><br />These are very nice visibility harness-style vests that seem to be made well, they are very adjustable and there is no question that they can be seen at night when light hits them. They come in a two-pack which at the asking price makes them even more attractive. If you need a reflective vest, give these a closer look.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"Wearable fitness bands are becoming popular these days. Like biometric scales they can track your progress and help you get a handle on your health by reporting your information easily and allowing you to connect to your phone or tablet so you can map your progress. I had hoped to start working with the Razer Nabu X and start taking some readings but unfortunately it has not worked out so well.<br /><br />The platforms for which it is designed to interact are iOS and Android. I have a Windows phone so that rules out my phone, at least for now (this is my fault, not the Nabu X’s fault). In spite of not being supported, it pairs and connects with my phone without any problem at all. I tried with an Android device, a Sony Xperia Z, and while it paired it would not maintain the connection. As such I have a device that I cannot use.<br /><br />I looked for a compatibility list and found a short list of compatible devices in the QA section of Razer’s support website. The Xperia Z is listed among the supported devices so I am not sure what might be causing the problem. Either it is not exactly compatible as they claim or I received a faulty device. The fact that it connects OK with my Windows phone suggests the former. I will be adding a new Android device, an HTC One, to my network in the next few weeks and will try with that device to see if I have better results.<br /><br />Aside from not being able to use it for its intended purpose, I would like to mention that it does fit comfortably. I have large hands and wrists and I wasn’t sure if it would clasp around my wrist, but it does (with a couple of holes to spare). It is not so tight as to cut off circulate and not so loose as to slip and slide. At least the fit is good.<br /><br />Unfortunately I cannot really test this device, as I cannot connect to it long enough to get any data from it. I will keep trying and will come back to update this review if I find success.",0.9648,439,29.266666666666666,0.1,1.5194400000000001
"Most resistance bands I have seen and used are the flat latex ribbons that have a nasty tendency to rip. I have tried surgical tube-based resistance bands as well and these are better than the latex ribbons but they still have a tendency to rupture and fray when used frequently. These resistance bands by Draper’s Strength are similar to giant, thick rubber bands and they are superior to other resistance bands I have tried. They’re also a LOT stronger.<br /><br />I should first say something about the price. Yes, these are a bit more expensive than other types of resistance bands though competitively priced against other bands of this type. These are a lot more substantial - all the way up to 200 lbs. of resistance tension without breaking - and they will last a lot longer under stress. Think of these as an investment, not a disposable tool. With proper care and used like they’re supposed to be used there’s no reason these should not last for years.<br /><br />These are color-coded to specify the amount of resistance each provides and the item description here on Amazon includes a chart shows the ranges for each colored band. Choose the colors that correspond to the strength you need. The chart also offers some suggestions for which types of exercise for which each band is suited.<br /><br />These seem to be very well made and feel very good when being stretched. They do get rather tight on the hands when pulling so I would suggest using gloves if using them for lift training.<br /><br />One word of caution - these are latex-based bands so if you have an allergy to latex please take this into consideration. The product description mentions that these are at least partially latex, and they smell like latex, so there should be no surprise that these are in fact latex.<br /><br />These are nice resistance bands, very well made and they provide a good range of resistance force against which to train and exercise. Yes, they are a bit more expensive than some other bands available on the market but these should last for a very long time when cared for and used properly.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"I have been a nylon monofilament guy for years. I tried Spiderwire as an experiment and truly hated it and quickly went back to mono, happy and content with it. I was not familiar with copolymer line and was provided some for testing. It has changed my opinion of mono.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have had with mono is that it is prone to memory (retaining the coil from the spindle on which it is spooled). Cast out and you get a plastic spring on the water. It doesn’t really hurt anything until you try to reel it in quickly with no load, and then you get a “rat’s nest” on the spool. I have not had this line long enough to tell if this is going to be a problem, but I have seen some other benefits.<br /><br />Compared to the same lb-test line, this copolymer line is slightly more limber and flexible. I never realized that monofilament is actually somewhat stiff - well, it’s stiff in comparison to the copolymer line, anyway.<br /><br />Something else I noticed about this line is that it is less likely to kink and snag in use. Monofilament has a bad tendency to get cuts and abrasions in it and I always assumed this was just part of the price one pays for the pleasure of fishing. I was startled to find that this doesn’t have to be the case. As a test I grabbed a phillips screwdriver and pressed the bit of it at an angle  against a strand of monofilament line and made an indentation. I did the same to the copolymer line and was surprised that the copolymer did not retain any misshapenness and did not show any signs of cuts. The monofilament showed a very small imperfection in the line where I pressed the screwdriver. Cuts in a line, even small ones, are often the difference between a catch and losing a good fish, and I am encouraged by the copolymer’s ability to be a little more resistant to damage.<br /><br />I have the green copolymer and it blends in nicely into the water.<br /><br />In casting the copolymer line peels off the reel very smoothly and with a good reel I get excellent casting distance. I don’t see too much difference between the copolymer and the monofilament when casting.<br /><br />I never considered anything other than monofilament before now. Copolymer line is new to me and so far it seems to be a little better than nylon monofilament. KastKing’s line is competitively priced too compared to other brands and it seems to be a good product. I have no basis to compare against other copolymer brands, but I will be gradually switching over to it and right now I’m happy with this brand’s performance.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"The picnic blanket that we have used for years is a classic red and white checker pattern vinyl rectangle. It's fine for small outings and it does provide a moisture barrier but it is small and not suitable for more than just one or two people. This is a very different blanket, suitable for picnics and for the beach and much better suited for larger groups.<br /><br />Unlike a terrycloth blanket or a vinyl sheet, this blanket is made of parachute nylon which has the advantages of being very lightweight and water resistant. It also is very non-bulky and folds up into a small and compact bundle in the *attached* bag, to a size that is slightly smaller than the average purse. I would not have thought it would pack this small, but it's absolutely perfect for packing for a trip.<br /><br />When completely unfolded this blanket is 7'x7', more than adequate for a group of 4-6 people. Being as light as it is, without anchoring at the corners it can easily get caught in the wind and blow around. So, each corner has a small elastic loop and included with the blanket is a set of 4 small stakes so that it can be better anchored down. Additionally, there are pockets on the corners so that additional weight can be added (rocks or sand) which helps even more when the ground is not suitable for relying solely on stakes. The packing bag doubles as a stash bag for things like sunglasses or a phone or it can be used to hold trash items until it's time to pack up again.<br /><br />Though this is marketed predominantly a blanket it is more useful to me and to my family as a table cloth for picnic tables. Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park has several picnic areas that are wonderful places to stop and spend time for lunch and this blanket covers those picnic tables nicely. The packing bag again serves double duty - it works well for holding utensils (spoons, ladles, etc.) while the blanket is spread on the table and it can again hold small amounts of trash until packing up to leave.<br /><br />This blanket is a very simple but very nice product that serves multiple purposes. It's fine for use on the beach and it works just for as a picnic blanket but it's just as useful as a picnic table cover. It packs up very nicely and is extremely portable and is not unreasonably priced.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"A lot of the winter activity in our house revolves around basketball. For years my two sons have played in leagues, have tracked teams and have even gone to games at the local high school (and once went to watch the Division III championship game). The SKLZ MagnaCoach Basketball Coaching Tool seemed like a good fit for this passion, and while it is a useful tool for coaching and stats tracking there are a couple of drawbacks with it that make it a little less than perfect.<br /><br />First, this is a clipboard-style utility that is roughly the size of a legal pad of paper. One side has a ball court layout and the other has a grid for tracking the game and keeping notes. It comes with magnetic tabs for better tracking of players and individual stats. The whole board itself has a little bit of heft to it, a bit heavier than we expected and definitely a bit better made.<br /><br />Included is a dry-erase marker that can be used to draw out plays and diagrams as well as record notes and stats. This is a good concept and is not a new idea. Other reviewers have mentioned that because the board is two-sided it lends itself to unintentional erasure when using both sides.<br /><br />A bigger concern to me, though, is that the surface is susceptible to scratches when put in contact with metal objects such as keys. If it gets tossed into a gym bag and there is something in the bag that can scratch the surface, it would be wise to find some way to protect the surface and to keep it away from other hard, sharp-edged objects, particularly when transporting.<br /><br />This is a useful coaching tool, designed reasonably well and more durable than we expected. The vulnerability to scratch and dent is a detriment, though, and in my opinion is the single biggest weakness of this otherwise nice tool.",0.9902,378,37.8,0.0,1.8970600000000002
"Though marketed as a bag for ski boots this bag is also suitable as a heavy-duty backpack and general storage bag. It is well constructed and will serve well in most capacities.<br /><br />My first observation on this bag is that it is make of heavier materials than the typical nylon bag. It feels sturdy. It is still a lightweight bag, though, so the added sturdiness does not appreciably impact the overall weight of the bag.<br /><br />This is a nice, roomy bag that is well-suited for ski boots, but it can be used for other things as well. I am hesitant to say it would be a good book bag because of the shape, but it makes a very good tool bag and even an excellent overnight bag when traveling. The shoulder straps free up the hands for carrying other things - like your ski boots.<br /><br />This is a very nice bag that will serve you well in its designed role as a boot bag, but it can be used for so much more if desired.

"I bought this from Amazon based on all the 5 star reviews. I have been wearing it consistently for 11 days and following the instructions as noted in the on-line user guide videos.  I am torn as to whether  to give this 3 or 4 start.  I ended up going with 4 stars because I have tried other trackers and the REIGN feature-set is hands above the other devices I have tried.  For me it is the best choice available, today.<br /><br />PROS<br />SIZING: Band design and fit is excellent. You are given 3 band lengths with every device, which ensure you will get the perfect custom fit. Before you buy, I strongly recommend you go the the Jaybird REIGN site's FAQ pg for exact sizing info.  http://www.jaybirdsport.com/static/img/reign/sizing-guide.jpg<br />Be aware, you want to determine the side-to-side width across the TOP of your wrist, not the circumference of your wrist. The REIGN is a 2 piece band.  The fit/width of the top piece is what determines which size to buy.  You then customize your fit with the bottom band, which is provided in 3 lengths.<br /><br />SECURE: the magnetic locking mechanism ensures your band will never fall off. The design allows you to easily secure your band with one hand.  Once it is magnetically secured, it will not come off until you manually disengage the magnets. Excellent design!<br /><br />COMFORT: Due to the lightweight, smooth silicone band, this is the MOST comfortable activity wearable I have ever tried. As a tech professional, I am typing on my keyboard all day long and cannot wear any watch-type devices or jewelry on my wrists. This is the 1st tracker device I have found that I can wear all day, every day. I barely notice it's on my wrist. I wipe mine down with a damp cloth. I have had no irritation or discomfort. 5 stars!<br /><br />TRACKING: The REIGN will track data by specific activity, which you will not get with other devices. It detects Walking, Swimming, Biking, Running and General activity. In addition to the 3 silicone magnetic wrist bands, they provide 2 stretch style athletic bands and an ankle biking band.  The STEP tracking is accurate for me ( Compared my data for a couple of days with a FitBit and Treadmill)<br /><br />SMART PHONE APP: The design of the SmartPhone app is a plus. The information provided is very good.  In additional to your GoZone score, you are given 3 screens of data: Activity, Sleep and History.  Each screen presents you with a Summary view and a Detail 'Timeline' view of that data.<br /><br />VISUAL FEEDBACK: The band itself provides visual indication of your progress towards your GoZone Goal via lights. Each light represents 9% of your goal.  (Dont bother enabling the 'Time' feature. The lights flash for 1 second and is pretty much useless)<br /><br />CHARGING: Very easy to pop the device out of the band and charge on the charger that is included. Via USB cord, it can be charged thru your laptop or a plug, your choice. As stated, it takes about 3 hrs to initially charge.  I pop mine onto the charger before I hop in the shower. Easy-peasy. Please note, if you lose the charger, you will have to buy a replacement since the charging doc is required.<br /><br />USER GUIDE:  I recommend you watch the online User Guide videos AND read thru the entire list of FAQs prior to purchasing/using the REIGN.  There is a lot of info in the FAQs that is not covered in the User Guide videos that you will want to be aware of.  A nice feature is, the videos are also part of the SmartPhone app.<br /><br />HISTORY:  the SmartPhone app. provides a History screen with Day, Week, Month & Year mode.  Once you select your mode, you can then swipe thru by Day, Week, Month...... Very nice.<br /><br />PERSONALIZED: The REIGN definitely does 'get to know you'.  After the 1st week or so, the daily goal has adjusted, based on my history.<br /><br />CONS:<br />GO ZONE: Upon waking up, you should be able to sync and log that day's GO ZONE feedback in 2 minutes. I have owned the REIGN for 11 days and rarely have I been ale to get GO ZONE to completed on the 1st try. Once the REIGN device is Connected to the SmartPhone app. and I Start Go Zone, I often get error messages and have to Start again. These issues are definitely specific to the GO ZONE feature, as I do not  get errors throughout the day when syncing. This is the key feature of the device, so I expect it to work without issue and not have to battle with it.<br /><br />SUPPORT: Unfortunately, I cannot give a good review on support. I sent a very detailed Email with screenshots from my SmartPhone listing the GoZone errors and Sleep monitoring issue I have experienced.  The response I received was very friendly, however the only thing the reply told me was I could manually enter Sleep info in the app. There was no response to my detailed GoZone issues and questions.<br />SUPPORT Review Update 12-29-2015: I received another reply from Jaybird Support addressing my specific concerns and questions. They have provided me with instructions of how to reset my Reign pod, indicating this may resolve my specific issues.<br /><br />READABILITY: I think the design of the app is great and it is easy to use.  However, it is not so easy to read on your Smart Phone due to the funky color of the font (pale yellow-green) against a light grey background.  It is not configurable. I understand these are the branded colors, but they do not lend themselves to readability on mobile devices.<br /><br />DASHBOARD: There is not an online Dashboard. Your data is only available via your SmartPhone app.  I went to the website and attempted to login  assuming there would be an online dashboard.  The online login is a separate account and  is for purchases, only.  The other tracker devices I have used have online Dashboards and settings, which I deem as a plus.<br /><br />DATA SYNC: Data sync is on-demand, which preserves you SmartPhone battery (Yay!). However, for some reason, data for previous day(s) is not always shown in the app. Periodically, when you open the app on your phone, it will show all zero's after syncing.  I have not been able to detect a pattern.  It is an intermittent issue that cannot be reproduced, on demand. The work-a-round is to close and reopen the app.<br /><br />TACTILE: Tapping the REIGN device 4 times does not active my lights.  I have to rap it pretty hard, 8 to 12 times. I have mine set for progress feedback, only. The lights flash for 1 second.  I would prefer a button that will allow me to quickly turn on the progress lights and turn them off when I release the button. ( If there were a manual button, the 'Time' feature may be of value).",0.9968,1467,22.227272727272727,1.7,2.40904
"I use a BodyBlade at home, which is too long to pack for air travel. So, I shipped this to my family's home to use while visiting. Great price @ $30 and a nice substitute piece of equipment. I was able to perform my BodyBlade routine with the TotalBar, with minor  adjustments.  Gave it to my nephew when I left and he loves it.<br /><br />I personally prefer the BodyBlade, but if cost is an issue for you, I would recommend the TotalBar as a very nice alternative.",0.9215,107,21.4,0.8,2.1164500000000004

"I like to be able to use jumping rope as an exercise activity, but sometimes the weather doesn't cooperate and I really don't have room indoors for a regular jump rope. This weighted jump rope is a great option for me. Plus I tend to be kind of uncoordinated so a cordless version like this one works better. The display is nice and simple, it has a couple of modes to choose from, I like the number of rotations the most and just keep track of the time on my watch. It's made well, durable and my hands can comfortably grasp the handles.",0.9822,115,23.0,0.0,2.29466
"I have a different style weighted hula hoop that I enjoy, but wanted to try this one too. I'm a little uncoordinated and clumsy, so much that I couldn't do a real hula hoop to save my life. So I figured that trying weighted hula hoops with a smooth consistent track would be the way for me to get my exercise in and not get frustrated when I can't keep the weight moving around.<br /><br />This weighted hula hoop is great for uncoordinated people like me. I can easily and consistently keep that weighted ball moving around me for 15 minutes. No worries about having to stop and restart, I can concentrate instead of keeping moving to keep my heart rate up. I've been able to remove at least one link already and hope to do more.<br /><br />I took off one star because of the disconnect button. It can be really hard to get the piece to let go to remove the hula hoop. It gets better with time, maybe it loosens up? But I do wish there was a better way to remove the hula hoop. At least one time I've had to yell for my husband to come help me! So it does need a little more design work to be a 5 star for me.",0.9936,253,23.0,0.3,1.9880800000000003
"The KABIKIU Smart Weighted Hoola Fitness Hoop is a fun way to get in some daily exercise. I like how smooth the track is for the weight to go around. I'm still working on going for longer and longer times, but it gets better each day (practice for the win!). It fits comfortably, though if you're plus size you may need to purchase a second one to use the knots to expand it. Or perhaps contact the seller to see if they have additional knots to purchase.<br /><br />The one detractor on this smart hoop is that the counter broke almost immediately. The wheels on the pulley block caught on the metal housing for the battery and broke it off, so I can't use the counter anymore. However, the hoop itself still works great, and since I prefer to go by time rather than number of repetitions I'm happy to still use it.",0.9806,179,25.571428571428573,0.0,1.89418
"I'm usually not a fan of the portable small umbrellas, because they can't handle the downpours and high winds in my area. But the Kailedi umbrella knocks it out of the park. Although small, it doesn't turn inside out when blasted with winds. The teflon coating keeps the rain from soaking through the umbrella. The portable size is really nice for keeping in my car.

"My husband is an avid golfer, so I selected this set of clubs for him to try out. The following is his opinion of the set-<br /><br />&#34;Perfect for an entry level golfer or as a spare set for guests, as mentioned in other reviews.  The driver, 3 wood and 5 hybrid have about the same, if not more, head weight than Callaway's current clubs, still too light for my taste (I play Titleist 910s).  Irons have tour-sized heads (not forgiving for off-center hits) but are weighted nicely.  Grips are standard, tacky as new but can't comment on durability.  The bag is the best part of the set.  Sturdy self-activating stand, seven well padded slots for the clubs, comfortable double-shoulder carry strap/harness, multiple zippered pockets for all the accessories and a slot, loop and cinch strap for an umbrella.  Nothing spectacular but a good set of clubs for the price. I give it four stars for the price & the bag.&#34;",0.9726,201,22.33333333333333,0.0,1.89178

"We’ve been using these with an indoor putting green with light up golf balls. My kids are significantly different heights at 3, 6, and almost 8 years old. It is really easy to adjust these putters to different lengths so they work well for each kid.

"My kids and I have been enjoying using this mat, especially with some light up golf balls I recently got. We turn off the lights and practice putting, some times for more than an hour (a very long time for easily distracted 6 and 7 year olds).<br /><br />The automatic return works well once set up properly, which I had to add more Velcro to keep it flat. Also, the long distance putting doesn’t return the ball straight back, so I’m not exactly sure what that mode is used for practicing. These are my only complaints, but the first was easily addressed and I prefer hitting balls into the holes as that is more satisfying than bouncing a ball off some foam. So neither of these are problems in my mind.<br /><br />A few notes on where to use this. The automatic return didn’t work on carpet (a medium pile carpet) or an area rug (a pretty firm surface). Also, my basement floor (laminate planks over concrete) is apparently not level in a certain spot. The ball kept breaking to the right, and I first thought the line was printed crooked. But I got my laser level out and I can confirm the lines are straight and they point to the center of each hole. Also, I measured the ramp/box portion with a bubble level and it was level. The box is sturdy (it can withstand a 50 lb kid stepping in it), and it is also pretty quiet with the strategically placed foam. This is a great product, and I highly recommend it.",0.9831,318,26.5,0.0,2.29493
"I love sitting around my fire pit on a cool fall evening. But the radiant heat only warms whatever is facing the fire. However, this chair balances out the problem! Gone are the chilly seat and back side feelings, resulting in longer and more enjoyable evenings around the fire. And the three heat settings are noticeably different, so you can dial in the warmth you want.<br /><br />The chair itself is very sturdy, and I’d even say it is overbuilt. The downside to this durable construction is that the chair is very heavy compared to the other camp chairs I have. Also, there are lots of built in pockets which are convenient, but the water bottle holder is not very big or deep. Additionally, the adjustable reclining feature is a nice touch. I didn’t see any instructions with the packaging, but you just lift up on the armrests and lean forward or back to change the angle of the seat. Last, the battery can be used to charge devices like an iPad or phone, so you can enjoy sitting around the fire even longer!<br /><br />This is a great product and I’ll probably get more soon so other people will stay around the fire as long as I do.",0.9641,250,25.0,0.0,2.28923
"I’ve been using these to practice putting on an indoor putting green with my kids. We like turning off the room lights and using just these balls to see where we are hitting. They are plenty bright for that purpose. Some of the lights are activated by a firm putt, but others require a bounce off the ground. The lights also last about 8 min before turning off.<br /><br />I’m not a very serious golfer, so I can’t tell how they play any differently from normal golf balls. But off my putter, these light up balls feel exactly the same as regular golf balls. I don’t know if I’ll ever play a round of golf at night, but I wouldn’t hesitate to use these. However, my kids and I are having fun with these so I’ll probably just keep them for indoor practice.",0.9073,177,22.125,0.0,2.27219
"My 3, 6, and 7 year olds are having a lot of fun using these adjustable putters. I can easily change the height to fit each kid, which takes one variable out of teaching them how to putt.<br /><br />The heads are similar to mini golf putters, so nothing fancy.

"I got the 15 ft version thinking that it would be more versatile than the shorter 9 ft one. However, in actual use, I think the 9 ft version would be just as functional.  9 ft is a pretty long reach, and by extending your arms you can get a couple more feet. Where I play the water visibility drops off quickly and 9 ft is more than enough. But, if the water is clear, the additional space requirements for the 15 ft (the handle is thicker because there are several more pole sections) may be worth it. And fully extended, the 15 ft sags a bit, but it is still easy to use and control. The head grips golf balls easily and securely.",0.9562,140,20.0,0.0,2.28686
"I don’t golf very often - maybe once or twice a year, so keep that in mind with this review.<br /><br />I am not too picky about the golf balls I use because I usually lose them within a few holes. And, when I’m looking for my ball, I usually find others that have been lost. So in a typical round, I play with a lot of different golf balls. Some feel harder or more stiff off the club, and others are more forgiving with a less harsh impact. These balls are closer to the latter. It is very satisfying to make solid contact with these balls. I can’t say if they fly further or shorter than other balls. Similarly, I don’t know if these have better or worse spin control. But a clean swing feels great, and the ball flies off the club. I’m very happy with these balls.",0.9554,184,18.4,0.1,2.31662
"These bike hooks save precious floor space in my garage. They are easy to install and are well designed.

"This is a nice upgrade from the cheap plastic syringe and plastic long needle I’ve been using to maintain my tubeless tire bike setups. This works much more smoothly, and the sturdy plunger is a pleasure to use (yes, there is a noticeable difference). Also, the metal needle on a flexible tube is much more convenient than the rigid plastic needle I’ve been using. Also, the cleaning needle is a nice addition to this kit. I haven’t had any clogging issues with bontrager sealant, but if I did, this cleaning needle would easily take care of it.",0.9274,116,23.2,0.0,2.27822
"The old saying that a person who has one watch always knows what time it is, but a person who has two watches is never sure, comes to mind here. If this is your only pressure gauge and you dial in your tire pressures based on this tool, you’ll be happy. But if you have a couple of different gauges like me, some on pumps and another that is independent like this one, then you won’t be exactly sure which one is accurate.<br /><br />However, consistency and precision is what matters. Based on several years of use and comparison to two other gauges and my car readouts, I trust my digital gauge on my bike floor pump for accuracy from psi ranges in the mid teens to the mid 50s. I took readings from several different pressures as benchmarked with my pump, and this analog gauge consistently read about 1 psi lower. That consistency is more than good enough for me. And by way of background, I’ve set up my mountain bike and gravel bike with tubeless tires, and I am particular about the pressures I run in different conditions.<br /><br />Also, this gauge has a rubberized face and comes in a sturdy and well padded case. Since this is a precision instrument, I appreciate the protection to keep this device working well.<br /><br />Overall this is an easy to use tool that feels like it will last a long time (as long as you don’t abuse it).",0.9352,299,37.375,0.2,2.34056
"This comes in many parts, and the instructions are not very good. The drawings aren’t to scale, so it is difficult to initially tell which part is what. The bolts are also packaged confusingly as they don’t match the parts they attach to. I recommend starting from the foot end and working up from there. Just expect some trial and error with the bolts.<br /><br />However once the stand is assembled, it is easy to adjust to fit the bike. It is also easy to mount and remove the bike. And, it is surprisingly stable with the bike on there. In sum, the assembly process is a bit tedious, but overall this is a good product.",0.7357,141,17.625,0.0,1.82071

"I did the Unbound Gravel 200 and, like many others during the race, got a flat tire. The sharp Flint Hills rock sliced about a 3/8 in cut in my sidewall around 45 miles in. I run inserts in my tubeless tire setup, so I really didn’t want to have to put a tube in because (1) it is really hard to get the tire off and (2) I didn’t want to have to carry the sealant covered insert 30 miles until the next checkpoint.<br /><br />I wasn’t sure if the Dynaplug would get the tire to seal or how long it would hold due to the size of the cut. I’ve had smaller sidewall cuts that regular bacon strips couldn’t fix. After using 2 plugs and spinning the wheel on its side a few times, I was very pleased to see the tire held air - and it held for the next 155 miles to the finish.<br /><br />I highly recommend Dynaplug and especially the Racer Pro model that holds 4 plugs. I wouldn’t want to go on any epic rides with any lesser tool. It is on the expensive side, but it is worth the peace of mind and ease of use.",0.9191,246,35.142857142857146,1.3,2.66573

"This light has a more focused beam than 2 other, less powerful ones I have. So it is extremely bright at the center, and it doesn’t diffuse so quickly.  This light is great for the rails to trails gravel rides I enjoy. Higher speeds are no problem with this light showing the way. For more twisty single track, I prefer a different light that has a wider beam for better peripheral vision.<br /><br />The battery life is really good, but the trade off for all that power is the weight and size. Also, this can simultaneously charge my bike computer, which is a nice feature for really long rides.

"My family of 5 recently went on a vacation with a lot of hiking. And while I can say that this is a great pack for just myself or for my + a child’s stuff, it is not practical/big enough for me to carry for my stuff plus my 3 small kids. It was stuffed to the brim with our 4 light jackets, water bottles and a granola bar each. The pack itself is beautifully made with quality material and good zippers. I love the hip belt pocket, the generously sized side water bottle pocket and I love the top backpack styled opening. All that said, this is not the pack for me at this point in my life. With 3 small kids, even our simple hikes of 1-3 hours require more capacity. I also own the Osprey Tempest 30, and if you plan to carry stuff for more than 1-2 people, I would recommend sizing up to that pack.

It was packed to the brim, bulging, and had to be packed and repacked strategically to get it all in there.<br />This 34 is the perfect size to be able to fit all of the stuff previously mentioned, but also give us extra room for additional snacks, cold weather or rain gear, or extra water. It still feels very manageable on my back and not overly heavy (especially after trading a kid carrier backpack for this one!!). The quality is great and the material is durable. The adjustable straps are also awesome for fitting the pack comfortably to my 5’7” frame. The only thing to mention is I do prefer the zip top entry of the 22 to this top flap, but it is not a deal breaker for me.<br />I had a very similar Osprey for day hikes that I purchased 15 years ago and that one is still in great condition after hiking national parks and local trails.

I used it with bontrager sealant and cleaned it out right away and it didn’t clog. Also, using the syringe is way cleaner than pouring sealant in the tire and having to carefully install the tire and not spill the sealant. Instead, I could focus on getting the tire beads to pop into place, and then I could inject the sealant knowing the tire was installed correctly.<br /><br />The valve core remover tool is nicely finished and easy to use.",0.926,178,44.5,0.0,2.2778

It doesn’t provide as much water flow as my camelbak’s bite valve. I also don’t like the bite valve cover as it is hard to undo while mountain biking and it annoyingly flops around if you leave it undone.

It is significantly bigger than my camelbak mule, so I can easily carry water, food, tools, spare tubes, and more for 5+ hour mountain bike rides. It also is plenty big enough for day hikes. The rigid back panel and harness comfortably and easily carries 25 lbs. Also, compared to my Statos 40, I definitely notice the lesser ventilation of the Talon 22.

My only complaint is that the chain cleaner is very small and flimsy. I would say that my park tool chain cleaner is 50% bigger, meaning it can hold way more degreaser. Also, the lid slides on (as opposed to the park tool which has metal latches) and I don’t know how much abuse the little plastic tabs can take.

Sometimes that required creative routing of the bungee. And I’ve broken a few bungee cords, which fortunately didn’t cause any damage or injuries.  But those risks are gone with these straps. They are plenty long to strap the front wheel to the down tube, even on my mountain bike (the front wheel is significantly further away compared to my road bike).

"I used these once, and they developed holes in the bottom already. There were only a few spots where I put a foot down or got off and pushed my bike. I don’t think these will hold up for much longer, especially if I use them on more challenging trails. Maybe these would work for road biking if you didn’t walk much, but I don’t recommend these for mountain biking unless you can ride the entire trail without stopping or putting a foot down.<br /><br />Aside from durability, the shoe covers worked well. I rode for 2.5 hours starting at 24 degrees with low wind and it warned up to the low 30’s by the end. I was at a bearable temperature for most of the ride. And I had a few shallow water crossings and my feet stayed dry.<br /><br />Also, the size xl fit very tightly over my size 9 shimano mountain bike shoes.",0.5127,190,27.142857142857142,0.0,0.55381
"This easily holds everything I need in my saddle bag. I can fit 2 tubes, 2 co2 cartridges, tire levers, a patch kit, a multi tool, and my keys with plenty of room to spare. And that isn’t even with unzipping the expanding section. My phone fits in there too, but I’d rather keep that in my jersey pocket.<br /><br />The construction of the bag is very good, and it feels nice and solid. The zippers aren’t weatherproofed, so I wouldn’t keep anything in there that can’t get wet, but the material sheds water well.",0.9324,126,25.2,0.2,2.3397200000000002
"This is a great starter glove. It isn’t very big, so it is easier to handle, and I think it helps teach hand eye coordination better than a bigger glove. However, I’m taking away 1 star because the leather is pretty stiff and it has been difficult to break in. Just playing catch isn’t enough because the throws with a tee ball are short, soft tosses. And my son doesn’t have the hand strength to flex the glove. Even after playing with it for probably 2 hours total so far, the glove is still in its original, stiff shape.",0.9796,119,19.83333333333333,0.0,1.89388
"This bag has a ton of room, but it’s dimensions just don’t work for me. I am less than average height (5’7”) and the bag raises the standover height to where I am sitting on the bag when I have both feet on the ground. And, there isn’t enough real estate between my stem and saddle for me to stand behind the bag. Taller folks with bigger bikes might not have this issue. Also, the width of the bag is exactly how far apart my knees are when I ride. So if the bag isn’t perfectly centered, my knees brush up on the side of the bag.<br /><br />The bag itself is well made, and I like how there are two compartments with separate zippers. It’s just that, for me, it is a little too tall and wide. I’ll keep looking for a different top tube bag that works better for me.",0.9568,191,23.875,0.0,1.08704

"This literally fits like a glove. It should stretch out a bit with more use, but it fits snugly right now. I typically wear size large work gloves and 8.5 surgical gloves, so my hands are probably average.<br /><br />The glove itself is soft and easy to break in. I think that is worth paying a little more for. Also, the padding works well, and the Velcro is easy to adjust.<br /><br />However, I do have one complaint. There is a seam or strap that runs right under the tip of my thumb. I can’t really tell if it is supposed to be there, but if I pull my hand out so the seam is above my thumb, my wrist is not all the way in the glove. I wish the seam or strap would be a bit higher.",0.9612,170,21.25,0.0,1.88836
"These feel really nice in hand - solid with some heft, but not too heavy. The coiled lanyard and sheath are also high quality. This is a big step up from my general purpose needle nose pliers.<br /><br />I like how these are spring loaded, which makes them very easy to use. However, I’m only giving it 4 stars because I wish there was a lock or a way to disengage the spring. They have to be kept in the sheath to stay closed.

"It’s strong, lightweight, and easy to tie - everything paracord needs to be. It is thinner than the other paracord I have right now, but the manufacturer claims 600+ lbs breaking strength. That’s more than enough for me.",0.8126,48,16.0,0.0,2.24378
"This is one of those things you hope to never use, but you will be thankful to have when it is needed. Overall the quality is good. The buckle is a nice, thick plastic and the compass, while very small, is accurate and agrees with my phone. There also seems to be a generous amount of parachute cord, but I didn’t unravel the parachute cord as it is probably only meant to be pulled apart once. Next, the flint was easy to shave. And last, the shaver is pretty sharp, so it could do more than just that one function. I wouldn’t recommend storing the bracelet unbuckled as you could easily cut yourself or whatever the bracelet is stored in. I will keep one these in my daypack.

The 6 x 4 ft goal is a little big for my basement, but it will be a good size for use outdoors when the weather gets nicer. Storing the goal is convenient because it easily folds up and you don’t have to take it apart.<br /><br />The only downside I found so far is that the poles are not attached to each other, and they come apart easily when setting the goal up.

"Usually when things are labeled heavy duty they are just not the flimsiest option out there. That is not the case with these anchors. Their holding power is limited by the soil. My yard is clay and it was difficult to drive these anchors all the way in. I had to use a wrench to get some leverage with the last few turns. But this meant the anchors weren’t going anywhere. I used these for a bounce house, and they were way better than the cheap plastic stakes that came with the bounce house.",0.3919,104,14.857142857142858,0.1,2.14757
"I am an avid cyclist and own several bikes - a road, a tri, a full suspension mountain, and a hybrid bike. They all fit on the rack without any problems. However, due to the design of my full suspension bike, I cannot fit any other bikes on the rack alongside that one. Also, some bikes with a short top tube may not work on this rack because the distance between the arms is not adjustable.<br /><br />I have used many bike racks, and this is one of the better ones, especially if you have a hatchback or suv. The glide mechanism is very easy to use with or without bikes on the rack, and it provides easy hatch access.<br /><br />I have a saris bones 3 rack that I have used for more than 10 years, and the straps on this rack are very similar. I have no doubt these straps will hold up to regular use without any issues.<br /><br />Last, I like how the pin locks the rack to the hitch and how there is a built in cable lock. However, it is only long enough to go through the bike frames, so I will likely still use a separate cable lock to go through the wheels.",0.9535,252,36.0,0.1,2.3160499999999997

Now she can ride alongside me when I am zwifting.",0.875,73,18.25,0.0,2.2625
"For context, I bought a 2017 D’Lite two years ago and that has more than 2500 miles on it. I typically ride 3-5 times per week for 10-20 miles each time. We usually ride on paved bike paths, but we have spent some time on gravel on a rails to trails type of path. Despite the heavy use, the trailer has held up really well.<br /><br />This updated D’Lite has the same frame and overall dimensions as the old model, but the new features make it better than ever. In no particular order, here is what I like about the new model:<br /><br />The built in front wheel makes the trailer usable as a stroller at a times. The old version could not be freestanding unless it was hooked up to a bike. There were wheel attachments you could buy, but I didn’t want to spend more money on that or carry it around with the trailer. I like how the new version has a front wheel attached to the trailer arm.<br /><br />The quick release for the trailer arm is way more user friendly. While the old model had a pin with a retaining wire that was hard to open, the new model has a pull pin that couldn’t be easier to use.<br /><br />The adjustable seat recline is quick and simple to use. Whereas the old version required adjusting a bunch of straps, the new version can be adjusted between three positions with a push of a button.<br /><br />The cover has more clear, see-through surface area. This makes the inside feel more open and it allows the kids to see more of the outside scenery.<br /><br />There are now plastic caps over the metal corners. I will no longer scrape or bang my knee or shin on those parts of the trailer while taking it out of the car or setting it up.<br /><br />My kids like the seats of the new model better than the old one. These have headrests and are easier to adjust compared to the old version.<br /><br />The frame and cover look to be the same design on the new compared to the old model. I really like the adjustable suspension, and I think it is worth the extra cost to give the kids a smoother ride. Also, I think the suspension makes the trailer easier to pull. And, while I haven’t ridden in the rain yet with this new one, the old design kept my kids dry during wet road conditions and even heavy rain. I have no doubt the new version will do the same sine the cover is the same design.<br /><br />Overall, I think the updated version is worth the premium over the old version, which was already a really good design to begin with.",0.9933,573,33.705882352941174,0.1,2.32799
"I’ve had many camelbak bottles throughout the years and enjoy using them. These liter sized bottles are my favorite.

"I’ve had a couple Podium Chill Camelbaks for over 10 years and love them. I was excited to try this Peak Fitness Chill. Overall they are pretty similar, but there are a couple differences.<br /><br />Size: the Podium comes in a 21oz and 25oz, whereas this Peak comes in 17oz and 25oz. I personally prefer the Podium 21oz, this 17oz feels a little small for my bike rides<br />Shape: the Podium is a traditional cylinder shape, this one is triangular. The triangular shape in this 17oz size is actually easier to get in and out of my bottle cage on my bike, so I kinda like it, but I never found myself annoyed with the Podium either.<br />Cleanability: This bottle is easier to clean than the Podium! The lid design is good and I can put a straw cleaner entirely through one side to the other. I cannot do that with the Podium, so I’m not entirely sure what is lurking between the top I can see and the underside of the lid.<br />They both have locking lids and similar water flow. This Peak comes with a mud cap as well which seems beneficial if you plan on tossing it in a backpack or gym bag, but I have taken mine off.<br /><br />Overall I like both bottles and prefer the Podium for the 21oz size, but this is a great option if you are fine with 17oz.",0.9915,289,36.125,0.8,2.1374500000000003
"My 2 and 3 year old have several Contigo bottles that are more than a year old and they are holding up fine with no leaks. They are ok to clean- I use a straw cleaner to get the straw and bite valve well and a bottle brush for the bottle. We only use them for water but don’t have any problems with leaking. The only thing is they are slightly larger than camelbaks and these get stuck in their car seat cup holders. Other than that, a great water bottle.",0.5789,99,19.8,0.0,1.77367
"My husband and I have used Camelbak bottles for over 15 years, and we both still use our insulated stainless bottles that are 9 years old. Our kids have been using the camelbak kids bottles for the past 2 years, and while I don’t believe a perfect kids water bottle exists, these are my favorite option. The main problem I’ve seen with camelbak kids bottles is that my 2 and 3 year old chew on the bite valve, which cause it to split wider than it should, then drip when the valve is open and it’s laying on its side. I have probably purchased 8 replacement bite valves for their bottles in the past 2 years because they only seem to last us 6 months or so before the leaking gets out of control. Thankfully Amazon sells 4 packs of replacement valves. If your kid is older and doesn’t chew on it as much, or even if they shut the valve after taking a drink, then that shouldn’t be an issue. Overall I like the camelbak design and I can clean it really well using a bottle brush and straw cleaner. As far as this stainless option goes, it is obviously more prone to being dented and banged up. We already have a nice gouge in the side after being dropped from 2 feet on to tile. But it will keep drinks cold for pretty much the whole day if you give it a few cubes of ice, and there won’t be condensation on the bottle. I love that I can put ice in this and not worry about it making a condensation puddle on my coffee table! I will happily take the dents in exchange for cold water all day long.",0.9829,325,27.08333333333333,0.0,1.89487
"This is an ok bike computer that is really easy to set up. I don’t need gps or mapping capability, so this checks off most of what I was looking for. I like how simple it is, and the display is very easy to read. However, the major issue I have is that this model does not display power metrics. You have to step up to the more expensive computers to get that function. To me, this seems like a feature that should be included at this price point. And the app is just ok. Sometimes it records hr data and gps, but other times it doesn’t. I don’t know why that is because I don’t change any of the settings and the computer displays hr data (from wahoo hr monitor) during rides. Overall I feel like it would be better to skip this computer and save up for the more expensive wahoo computers.",0.9565,179,17.9,0.1,1.5169500000000002
"We were a bit scared to purchase this brand since it seemed like there are occasional quality issues without great customer service, but the one we received almost 2 months ago works perfectly! It is great to ride with Zwift and such a better experience than the dumb trainer we’d been using. We can switch from my husband’s bike to mine in under 5 minutes. And it is SO quiet, which is the main reason we chose this over Wahoo. My parents have a Wahoo, and it is loud compared to this Tacx. Overall a great purchase.

"I love Camelbak for the most part. I own more than 6 other bottles, varying from the sport kind to stainless to other hard plastic bottles, but this one has not met expectations. The filtering works well, but I have had two defective bottles within a 5 month period. The first I was able to return to Amazon for a replacement. Now I am on my second, and just within the last month the bottle began leaking terribly. Even with the bite valve down, water pools under and around the valve and then eventually dribbles down the side of the bottle, causing a huge pool of water underneath the bottle. It makes a mess all over my desk and then if I slightly tilt it for a drink, the water that has pooled in the lid gets all over me. Unfortunately I cannot exchange it at this point anymore.

It would lift from the sand, or not be positioned correctly at all, and allow sunlight to enter from the back. We've had to utilize rocks and beach towels to compensate.",0.9591,219,21.9,0.0,1.4877300000000002
"Fun tabletop hockey that fits small hands best. My kids love playing with the themed pieces, and the air surprisingly is powerful considering it's powered by batteries only.<br /><br />Some pieces could be better, however. The plastic bars that divide the board into players' halves easily pop out. Almost every game, they fly out because one player hits them.<br /><br />There is a solo version for this game, too. The character pieces are lined at the end of the goal (a separate goal piece is used for the solo game); knock them out and you ""win."" But the pieces are very easy to knock over. There is very little challenge to it, so much so that my kids never play that variant.",0.9474,155,22.142857142857142,0.2,1.94422
"I use this during my jogs. During summer months, I have a jogging schedule that increases with each month; during my runs in the final week of each month, I run with this weighted vest.<br /><br />It fits me well when I strap it on. I am 5'8"" and 160lbs; I cinch the straps almost all the way, making the vest as close to my body as possible. After first usage of this, I realized I can't have it too close because it makes breathing difficult. But I can't find a comfortable spot; when I loosen the straps just a bit, the vest bounces with each stride. There's no happy medium.<br /><br />Still, the weight is distributed nicely.

I wouldn't recommend wearing these to work or on casual Fridays. Because they compress the feet, there's not much cushion on the outside to fill the space of shoes. Therefore, it's best to wear these with athletic shoes, which are more form-fitting. They stain like normal socks, but at least when they do the stains look more like rubbed dirt after a wash.<br /><br />The only issue is that they attract fuzz a lot.

"My dad used to have a few of the old plastic Gatorade bottles, so these are more so nostalgic for me. I was curious to see how a stainless steel version would fare, and I'm super glad to say these are far better than the old ones, but with one small drawback.<br /><br />It's stainless steel, so it can help keep your liquids cooler longer and is far more durable. The green is made of ""gator skin,"" which is far grippier than I thought. It can hold a grip in dry or wet skin and is neither irritant to the touch. The orange cap disassembles for cleaning and is very easy to open.<br />Here's where my one drawback is. With plastic Gatorade bottles, I'm used to squeezing it a bit to get more liquid out faster. With this, you obviously can't, and the orange lid allows for more of a trickle than a steady stream. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but the green bottle says to me ""squeeze,"" but here I can't.<br /><br />It's a cool bottle nonetheless, and is my go-to bottle in the gym now.",0.9674,237,29.625,0.0,1.89022
"I actually got these to use around the house. Regular handle pliers are nice, but being able to use these as ""straight"" pliers is extremely beneficial.

I can't get good leverage because of hte angling (apt pun) and then pulling once I've got the griop is additional awkwardness because I can't pull straight. These eliminate the wonkiness. Not only are these pliers made of seemingly durable steel, but the grips are very comfortable and seem like they'll hold a long while. I've already used them to modify a handful of items and I foresee myself using these as my main pliers for years to come.<br />They come with a plastic band that keeps them closed to prevent unnecessary wear in the tool bag, but unfortunately I've lost mine.",0.7855,184,26.285714285714285,0.0,2.23565

Thankfully, they're marked on each foot with stitching so you can't forget. :)<br /><br />The white variant, however, seems to be a bit smaller for some reason, even though I received the same size.

"As soon as I opened the box I fell in love with the watch. Despite its small size (I prefer cases as close to 40mm as possible), the watch looks handsome on my wrist and the materials for the case shine brightly and elegantly, though not sure how long that will last. Considering this is a sports watch, however, I'm not sure if the look suits the market for the sports players as well, but since I'm no athlete I'm fine with it. The band seems a bit too soft, and I'm afraid that with time and constant stretching it will tear.<br /><br />Once you download the app, setting up and syncing is pretty quick. Takes no more than five minutes to get everything running (if that), and no more than ten to get your preferred settings in.<br />The inside screen is SUPER nice, and honestly something I wish most, if not all, hybrid watches had. I have a smartwatch and my initial thought was that one of the complications was a screen; not so, but with this Nokia it is. It's a monochrome display that displays the bare minima, but honestly that's what I would prefer with a hybrid smartwatch rather than having it as a glorified pager.<br /><br />The notifications are nice, and tell you exactly who is texting or calling, and what alarms and meetings you have up. Much more preferable than other smartwatches, I think. The other complication shows the battery percentage, which, according to the manual, will stay charged for a long time.<br /><br />The construction is handsome. Very, very nice.

"This is an initial impressions commentary less than it is a review. I plan on following up once I've had at least a month's worth of activity with it. Here in Chicago, the weather has been varying at the time of this review, so we've been able to use this only about a solid week's worth.<br /><br />The night I received it I assembled it immediately. I've put together a few strollers, so I didn't intend on taking longer than twenty minutes. Not with this stroller. It took me almost an hour. The instructions came in two parts: one sheet indicating that it may be difficult to unfold at first, and the main instructions. Indeed, the stroller is very difficult to unfold at first, and it is difficult to fold back.<br />The instructions were not very coherent; the illustrations, instead of being reference models as in most manuals, were black-and-white photographs which made it difficult to discern exactly what they were trying to portray. Half the time I was trying to figure it out, and ended up going with my gut-feeling (which, thankfully to my previous stroller assembly experiences, led me to the correct outcomes).<br /><br />Unfolding it the first time proved very difficult. Again, I did this myself with the assumption that it wouldn't be very difficult, so I did have a harder than usual unfolding it into its locked position. Once everything was assembled (mind you, you will need to provide your own tools as mine came with the wrong sized hex/L wrench and was missing the other tool, whatever it was), I was ready to put it in the basement for the time being. We live in a pretty spacious apartment building with plenty of basement storage, and that's where we store all of our strollers, etc. Folding it back was pretty rough; I could not for the life of me tell where the unlocking mechanisms were due to the poorly lit photographs, so I had to figure it out. Once I got it, however, one side of the locks was very hard to unlock.<br /><br />On our first walks, however, the stroll was fine. It glides pretty smoothly, but I wish the handlebar had an easier and quicker way to adjust the angle, as our previous strollers have. As I mentioned before, it's very difficult to unfold and requires two people, so when my wife tried to get the stroller out on her own she was unable to due to the force required. Who knows how this will be with time.<br /><br />As I've mentioned, I will follow up with a more experienced review.",0.6941,533,31.352941176470587,0.3,1.09823
"I’ve been wearing the REIGN band for a few weeks now and love it.  It comes with several different sized bands so the band fits just right.  I emailed the company and they offered to send me a band that would better suite me as the extensions included with my REIGN band were a bit too big.  It’s extremely comfortable to wear and feels very similar to wearing a watch.<br />How to use the band is a bit confusing though, as it does not come with directions.  You have to download the app that goes along with the REIGN band in order to access instructions.  The app is extremely user friendly and is easy to understand.<br />The sleep tracking has been especially helpful.  My daughter hasn’t been sleeping well lately, which means I haven’t been sleeping well.  The REIGN band has shown me exactly how many hours I have slept, how many hours I was restless, and how many hours I was awake during the night.  There was only one night that it did not track my sleep.  I believe this was due to taking off the band during the day.  The app states to keep the band on in order to get an accurate reading for sleep.<br />This fitness band and app have really shown me just how inactive I am.  It has been really disappointing to look at the app and realize that I haven’t even hit 50% of my activity score!

When I actually had my chances I found that the bow was slightly easier to use than my older one as there was less tension because of the shorter strings. The arrows are less clunky to use because they're shorter (yes, sometimes the older model would have too much stem to get in the way). I realize this in no way imitates the longer bow and arrows these model after, but it's great for kids with shorter limbs.<br /><br />We didn't use the lights much since we used them primarily in daylight, but as the sun set we did notice that the lights helped locate them when the arrows were fallen in the grass.",0.8607,216,30.857142857142858,0.0,1.8582100000000001

"I used to own a Radica Bass Fishin' game, until the reel on the device broke. No, I wasn't violent with it. Actually, I think it broke because I sat on it (I was a heavy child). Nevertheless, I had much fun with it, and wanted a replacement ever since.<br />When I saw this available for the iPhone, I snatched it right away, hoping to relive the Radica days.<br /><br />I noticed right away that the menu is a little confusing to navigate. The app developers chose to go with a heavy app--meaning graphically and operationally--which sucks battery and requires lots of interactivity to work it properly. Once I got fishing, though, it was pretty simple.<br />And that's another problem; it's *too* simple. I get a bite as soon as I drop the line, which sort of diminishes the fun. Reeling in fish is trickier, with a lot of the line cutting almost always. The reel could also use some sensitivity adjustments, because my slowing down didn't reflect in the app itself.<br /><br />I think the main complaints I have are with the app itself, so we could see major improvement in the future.<br /><br />The device itself is great and sturdy.

"I really do not like leaving bad reviews for products, but there is not much that is good about these goggles. They are cute so I'll give them that. But they do not stay on my son's head and they fall apart WAY too easily. They come with adjustable nose pieces, which in theory sounds like a cool feature. But in reality it just means these goggles come apart every time you try and put them on your child's head. Every time. They just pop apart as soon as you try and stretch him. I had also hoped that the extra wide band with the grippy things on the back would actually hold the goggles on his head since his other goggles always slide down, but no such luck! These goggles slide right down his head too. Which means he leaves them on for all of about 2 minutes before he wants them off again. They also don't fit his face well and therefore the water just pours in. They literally lasted about 5 minutes at the pool and then have sat at the bottom of the pool bag on each trip to the pool after that. They are completely useless.

"Very pretty robins egg blue metallic color. LOL.  It is lightweight, with an extra wide base that doesn't wobble.  It would take more than a nudge to tip it over.  The loop at the top is attached securely so I won't worry so much when it is hung up.  Nice tall area for the flame.  This should produce some heat as well as light in those emergent situations.<br /><br />Update:  Having recently experienced a power outage when temps were near freezing I can say that using 2 put out enough heat to keep my bedroom tolerable for several hours.  I use the kerosene that is labeled as odorless but there is a slight odor.  It makes a bright flame but it is the heat that I needed most.  I now use it in the evening to get the chill out of the air when I am getting into bed and near my shower so its toasty when I get out.  I didn't plan on using it this way but it is a better option than my electric heater which costs a small fortune to operate.  This is a real bargain.  The quality is excellent and it couldn't be easier to use and to clean.  I highly recommend it for more than just emergency light.

"So far, I love this HRM.  I've used HRMs since the early 90's starting with a Polar.  The Polar and the last Timex I owned had a flexible plastic strap.  I don't have a large chest so the contact area of the chest strap did not make a good contact with my body.  Well that has all changed with this model.  The design of the chest strap has been improved.  The contacts have been incorporated right into the stretchable portion of the strap and the contact to my chest is direct and  immediately provides heart rate information.  The functions on the buttons seems to change with every version of watch I buy (the last one I bought was in 2008, a Timex).  If this is your first HRM then you wont have any 're-learning' to do like me.  I'm not sure of the tap technology yet.  It seems like it might be a good idea, but for me (right now I have it on 'medium' sensitivity) it takes multiple taps.<br />If you're a runner, like me, then seeing your heart rate information while you're running might be challenging. If I want to see my heart rate while running at my fast pace, I usually have to slow down to see the screen effectively.<br /><br />The only real grip I have with all my HRMs up to this date is the waterproof 'o-ring' type seal.  After 4 or 5 years the battery has to be changed and my o-ring has been deformed in that time, so it doesn't quite fit the way it should (to make the watch waterproof).  Enough so that the waterproof watch is no longer water proof.  I lost my polar watch and my last Timex watch due to this issue.  And usually after this long time the watch is discontinued and the o-ring has too.  I will either buy a new o-ring for the watch now, or know that when I replace the battery I can no longer wear the watch in the shower or swimming.<br /><br />You might think, &#34;why did he give it 5 stars&#34;.  I use the information from the watch, mainly, after my run to track my conditioning AFTER my run (I like the 'recovery' option of the watch), and now that I know what to expect when changing the battery, I know what I can't do.  I think the benefits of this watch far out-weigh the issues that I've outlined above.  Tracking my heart rate over time is just another statistic for judging my overall health.",0.982,505,25.25,0.1,2.3245999999999998

To give them a proper workout, I bought four of these, one on each side of each dog.<br /><br />If one were to purchase these weights for this reason, you should go at 10-15% of their weight with each side even (1 5lb weight on each side = 10lbs which is 12.5%. Also make sure the dog pack allows for a focus of the weight to be at the shoulders - especially since the size of these weights do not provide an even distribution for medium or larger dogs.",0.5574,170,28.33333333333333,0.0,1.36722

I've had biting bugs that were under my horse's belly that they kept kicking at and with this whisk I can even reach down and shoo them away.  It also reaches back to their flank without a problem.  In fact, there is no place this won't reach.  The only time you might have to bend over is to get one that is at their feet area.<br /><br />Some desensitizing to the horse may be necessary before using.  My horses had a lot of desensitizing done beforehand and needed no time at all to get used to this, but, I have had others who got one because I had it and it works so well but their horses were afraid of it.<br /><br />You have to know your horse.  It is something I would highly recommend getting your horse used if they are afraid of it so that it can be used.  I highly recommend this product and I won't ride without it.

"While I bought this lock to try and keep my new e-bike mine. The lock itself looks like it will do the job, but be aware. This lock is a bit short for my exact e-bike (Lextric XP step thru 2.0). It might be hard for it to go through anything more than the frame and possibly lock on a structure that thieves can't move. Most likely I will have to use this lock in combination with other locks to get enough length to secure all the wheels and still reach a structure to keep the bike from being dragged away. The included cable is nice to be included. Just not sure how well it would survive a cut attack.<br /><br />While D-Lock style locks seem to be the best to stop average thieves. Until a real pro thief tries to steal your bike. Its hard to say how well this lock will do. It looks like this Sigtuna lock and the 2 other locks I have should do the trick to keep my bike mine.<br /><br />I will also mention that a regular tube style frame is fine for the lock holders for the D-Lock and cable. They might be a challenge to use on an E-Bike that has a frame with internal battery and few tube areas to mount to.<br /><br />I'll update my review should anything happen.

There is even a storage area where extra batteries can be stored.<br /><br />These are perfect to keep around the house when the electric goes out, for use while camping, keep one in the car 'in case'.<br /><br />SO glad I bought these!

"Nordic's Mini Stepper/Stair Climbing Machine is perfect for me.  I love that I can use it in the privacy and comfort of my own home. Plus, it saves $ on gym membership fees!<br /><br />I was super surprised as to how light the stepper is.  It only weighs 16.5lbs. For some reason, I assumed it was going to be heavy. Nope.  But don't worry-just because its lightweight doesn't mean its not sturdy. Its incredibly sturdy.  It stays in place and doesn't wobble or tip at all.  The small size of the entire machine takes up very little room while in use and while stored in the closet in between uses.  Features include a small data display, an exercise guide and resistance bands/handles.<br /><br />Sadly, I naively assumed since I walk 5-6 times per week, I'd just hop on the stepper and off I'd go. WRONG! lol.  I started out only being able to use it for a few minutes at a time.  Thanks to daily use, every day I'm able to use it longer and longer and without trying to sound vain, I'm kind of impressed with myself and my progress.  I don't think of it as a chore, I actually  look forward to using my stepper daily.  I sometimes watch TV or listen to music while using it.  It works very well.  The steps are easy to move, they don't jam or get stuck, etc.<br /><br />I've not yet tried the resistance bands. I injured my arm in a slip and fall on ice a few months ago (actually, I fell twice on the same darn patch of ice ! lol).  I see my orthopedic doctor in a few weeks and plan to discuss the bands with him at that time.  For now, I only use the stepper.<br /><br />I wish I would have had this throughout the pandemic last year.  Better late than never, I'm thrilled to have it now.  It provides a good workout that I don't dread and best of all, its in the comfort of my own home.  If you're looking to start or add cardio/toning  to an exercise regimen, I highly recommend the Nordic stepper.  Give it a try; before you know it,  you'll see results and look forward to using it.  Nordic offers a 1 year Manufacturer's warranty as well.  I believe the price is reasonable and worth every penny!",0.9877,489,16.862068965517242,0.1,2.32631
"My husband and some friends he hasn't seen in quite some time got together and went fishing yesterday.  He was excited to try out his new Jack the Ripper jerkbait fishing lure. He was impressed with it for a number of reasons: the size, the realistic appearance and realistic movement of the lure when in the water and the sharp hooks.  He did use the lure for trolling while on a boat which is not something he normally gets a chance to do, so he really appreciated the experience.  I'm not sure which was worse for him...the fact that he didn't catch any fish (the lake they went to hasn't been stocked yet) or the fact that his friend DID catch a small trout while using my husband's rod. lololol. He still had a good time and they have plans to go again soon.

He didnt' actually go fishing, he just cast it it a few times and got the feel of it. I rarely fish so my review is based on what HE said about it.<br /><br />He said the reel is nice and smooth.

"My husband owns , uses and likes Hissox athletic socks. He gets a lot of use out of them and he says they hold up well.  With regards to this particular sock, the Hissox men's low cut no-odor/no show workout socks, he does kind of like it but says its, ""not my favorite"" (out of all of the Hissox he currently owns).  This sock is comfortable and light and the 'no odor' claim is correct.  But according to him, this particular Hissox sock doesn't hold up as well as the other Hissox he owns.  The second time he wore this sock, the sock itself began to wear down on the bottom of the foot portion of the sock on both feet.  This area did not 'spring back' into place after the socks were washed, you can see a noticeable area on each where the sock is  worn down.  This particular pair of Hissox has been worn only twice and unlike his other Hissox (as well as other brands of athletic socks he owns), it doesn't look like this pair has much life left in it after only two uses.  He is pleased with the comfort, the fit and the no-odor portion of the sock.  But the quality of this particular Hissox (and ONLY this sock!!!!) is not up to par with the others and it is unlikely he will use or purchase this  sock again.

"I take my dog to a lake on a daily basis (except during winter) to walk.  I always take at least one bottle of water for us to share.  (I pour the water into my hands and he drinks the water that way.  He doesn't drink out of the water bottle, only I do! lol)  When its very warm outside, we need more than 1 bottle.  That means I'm juggling multiple water bottles, holding the leash plus the dog waste bags to clean up after him.  He's not a very big dog but more than once when he has seen a person he knows or another dog, he takes off to visit and catches me off guard and of course, my multiple water bottles go flying through the air while trying to keep a hold on his leash.  A weeks ago, I started to use the Llevargo collapsible water bottle instead of juggling multiple water bottles.  And it works great for us! I still pour the water into my hand for him to drink out of and I still drink out of the bottle, the same way we've always done it. But now, I don't have to worry about multiple water bottles.  I don't have to worry if the Llevargo bottle falls because .it won't break or crack!  The water stays nice and cold throughout our walks.  But the BEST part about this bottle is the way it collapses.  Once we've finished the water, I collapse the bottle which reduces everything I'm juggling at the same time!  If the dog attempts to bolt, I can stop him immediately and that is so  VERY important.  I would die if he got away from me and something bad happened to him!<br /><br />I love this bottle.

"Bought specifically for car camping... 2 adults, a 3 yo and a 60lb dog. Would easily fit 4 adults shoulder to shoulder. Incredibly easy to set up and take down with one person. Sturdy and roomy!

I read a TON of reviews on different brands and pulled the trigger on this one. My husband is in the military and deploys frequently. Purchased as a gift for easy travel. Quality is fantastic! The pole extends and retracts smoothly as advertised. The fishing reel is high quality and smooth. Nice padded travel case to keep equipment protected. We own an embarrassing amount of fishing equipment from moving all over the country therefore targeting different species of fish and this fishing pole rates up there with our best rods!

We love the included screen for the ability to scroll through pictures on site without having to take it home, view the pics then trudge all the way back out to the camera site. What a time saver! And ALL of this is packed into such a small package that makes it great for hiding the camera.. not only from the game, but more importantly from any humans that may come across it and think they just found a treasure they can take home.

"I received this box of 4 Tone It Up Birthday Cake Protein Bars on 1/11/21 and they have a Best By date of 5/6/21. They smelled and looked good when I opened one up. The taste was similar to a granola bar but not as crunchy. They were a tad on the sweet side, probably thanks to the lines of frosting on top. And, oddly enough, I could have sworn I tasted cinnamon but according to the ingredients list there is no cinnamon in them. A few minutes after I had finished the bar, I had a oat flavored chalky after taste in my mouth. Overall, they were tasty but a touch too sweet for me and I didn't care for the after taste.",0.9073,137,19.571428571428573,0.0,1.47219

There's room for it to grow with him for a few months before he won't fit in it anymore and I'll donate it to our local shelter along with his other puppy items. It's a decent thickness and the print is a vibrant bright red.. very easily seen on our walks. I've laundered it a few times now (cold water, high heat dry) and it has come out as good as new each time. I'm impressed enough that I'll probably buy him a larger size when he outgrows this small one.",0.9499,120,24.0,0.0,1.88497
"I was excited to order these bandanas for my adult Corgi, Skip, and my new puppy I'm picking up soon! I got the red and the navy blue and even though there is no option to choose the size you want, based on other reviews, I was expecting the red to arrive in size small and this navy blue to be size medium/large. That is not the case. The blue one arrived first, in size small and unfortunately is too small for Skip. I can get the collar on him, but the ends barely overlap, leaving just enough space for the velcro to catch and the front triangle of material is laughably small on him.<br /><br />I love the adorable print! There's images of squirrels, fire hydrants, balls, steaks and paw prints and cute sayings.. ""Quite Fetching"", ""Ain't Too Proud To Beg"". ""Smell Ya later"", You Gonna Eat That?"", I'm All Ears!"", ""Gotta Run!"", ""Yo Dawg!"" and ""Shake On It"". The product description claims that ""the pattern is printed in reflective ink"". I did not find this to be the case. The ink is silver and while it is shiny and kind of metallic, reflective it is not. This is not a deterrent for me, but may be for others.<br /><br />I do like the velcro closure! I usually steer clear of dog bandanas because I don't like having to tie them on which makes the dog look silly with the two ends sticking out.. and I have rarely had luck finding a bandana that's the right size to my dog. I usually end up with a too large bandana (Corgi's a small-ish) that I fold in half into the standard triangle, tie it around his neck and then, not only does he have those ""wings"" sticking out from the tie, but he also is dwarfed by the size of the triangle in the front. My dogs don't need a bib or a necktie. LOL!<br /><br />The sizing on this navy blue bandana (I have yet to receive the red one and am now quite curious to see what size shows up) is perfect for a smaller dog. I planned on Skip wearing this navy blue one, but it seems it will be given to my new Corgi puppy. The size small that I received will fit him properly and look right. I can only hope that I receive the red in a size medium/large so Skip gets to wear one too. If not, then the new pup will be off to a great start in the wardrobe department!<br /><br />Bottom line... These are quite cute, very well made, the velcro is strong enough to hold through a round of scratching and seems as though it would hold during light play (we'll put that to the real test when our new puppy arrives!) and the size of the bandana itself (referring to the navy blue only) seems correct. But not being able to select the size you will receive is just shocking. It almost feels like a shot in the dark to order this - what size will I receive this time? That is not how anyone likes to shop and I'm surprised there is no size selection available for this reason.",0.9938,664,23.714285714285715,0.0,1.8981400000000002
"I use this in my massage therapy practice. I always start each session with my client face down on the table. Once I have them roll over to the supine position (on their back), I place this pillow on their eyes for two reasons. First, to block the light out - even though my treatment room is dimly lit, any light can be intrusive and disrupt relaxation after being face down with your eyes closed for 20-30 minutes. Secondly, to continue promoting relaxation with the use of the lavender scent. My clients love this pillow (even some of the men have requested it) exclaiming that it is just that extra touch they need to reach complete relaxation. This pillow comes highly recommended by, not only myself, but my entire clientele!",0.8355,147,21.0,0.5,2.4006499999999997
"Purchased for: 2012 Ram 1500 Laramie CC<br /><br />First off, the visor organizer I received looks nothing like the one pictured above. I have posted an image of mine for comparison purposes. This is the reason I removed one star, since I didn't receive the item as pictured and that I had thought I would then be receiving.<br /><br />Not much to say, it's an organizer. Zippers work, velcro closure on the side leaning flap works. This attaches to the sun visor with four straps that wrap around the front and back of the visor and attach to themselves with velcro. For right now, they are holding. But on my truck, these straps are just long enough to wrap and overlap each other to ensure a good grip on the visor. I assume they will continue to hold since I do not plan on loading the organizer with too many items or papers (just my registration, insurance card and a pen for now) but I could see this not holding long if I were to add anything of considerable weight.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the organizer since it is very nice having a dedicated place to store my reg and ins close at hand (in my truck the glove box is a far reach from the driver's seat). I would recommend this product - with the side warning that the item you receive will not look like the one pictured.",0.9706,288,32.0,0.0,1.89118

I paid the $5 for set of three as is stated as the cost in the description. I am somewhat confused, and disappointed, that these are so much now. They do last a long time, but I do not think they are worth more than $5 each.

"'Connection Lost' is what I get 75% of the time when trying to connect with Alexa, even though I am 3 feet away from the Echo device and 6"" from my smartphone. I have WYZE cams throughout my house and other WYZE products, but since they solely depend on my phone app and have no links to my laptop or computer, function is sketchy at best when it comes to contacting Alexa. With my WYZE cam, Alexa notifies me 7 minutes after the cam picks up someone at the front door. Yesterday, Alexa told me someone was at the front door... An HOUR later!

I decided to look up walking sticks and what a difference these have made for me! I can walk safely in the snow and mud with the attachments. The physical therapy group I go to twice weekly marveled at the fact the sticks came with so many attachments for different surfaces, the sturdiness, shock absorbency and the ease of changing them, plus the affordability.

"So partner on 30-day heart monitor and had taken it off post-30-day.  Doc had said get either a watch or Kardio Mobile moving forward.  I chose this product in lieu of Kardio's first model or a watch.  She's been using it for a week now and was in afib.  Took her to ER yesterday.  Docs asked her symptoms and she said I have a record in my Kardo Mobile app.  They are well familiar with the old Kardio product but had not seen this new version.  She pulled it out and showed these 2 cardio docs, a NP and PA the new product and how she uses it.  We're in Atlanta's premier heart hospital..... so we're impressed that they're impressed.  It works, it's easy to use and the cardio team likes it.  That's all you need to know.",0.9854,160,14.545454545454543,0.4,2.41562

"What I like about this product is the ease of going between a straight shot and a curve shot. I purchased a storm C2 glove at first, when I got the glove the mechanism was complicated to me. Also, the bracket that held the strap that goes around your wrist; that clamp was loose and everytime you released the strap, the clamp would fall. Calling and speaking with the seller was not helpful in minimizing the concerns of losing the clamp or making all the gadgets less complicated. I asked him if all of the devices came with an unattached clamp, and he assured me that they all come that way now. I have been using a pro release glove for many years. Well I  returned the storm. I went ahead and purchased the Brunswick bionic from a different seller on Amazon, bowl.com. the glove is not anything like the storm c2. The clamp is secure to the strap and very easy to put on and take off. The mechanism is uncomplicated to work and the adjustment works well to release the action on the ball. Perhaps the other seller is a representative for storm, I don't know,but he know nothing about his products to have given me such a untrue story. Am happy I went with my gut and brought this glove.

[[VIDEOID:58a724d1a5a1c78a092de4a36fddf332]] Purchased this treadmill even though I have seen some bad reviews on it. Mostly because of the Ifit membership required to activate. Myself I activated on ifit with no problems and the options are great for anyone trying to lose weight or need a little help or support. My issue is with the treadmill itself as you can tell its not a small price. But after we put it together the treadmill is constantly making a squeeking sound when you step on it to use it. It makes almost like a small chirping sound while using it as well. I have done research and have read to make sure its level which it is and to also make sure to possibly relube it which I have and nothing has helped.<br /><br />The sound is annoying and very frustrating knowing it is brand new and everything else seems to work I did purchase the 3 year warranty in which I plan on calling them and discussing this issue with them further. But it is very disappointing to order a good name brand product like this to already have an issue within 3 days of purchase smh. This will be the last product I ever purchase from Norditrac as it does not deliver the high end product I thought it would have. Very disappointed in this purchase and very upset that this was an issue right out of the gate with this product. We thought maybe it was unlevel but we leveled it completely and that is not a possible issue either. Hopefully after contacting them they will have a fix or solution to this issue. I will update this review later. I included 2 pictures and a short video so you can hear the sound it makes.,0.1288,322,23.0,1.0,0.73864

"I seriously don't know how this lamp is receiving so many 5 star ratings, the one I got is of absolute horrible quality.

In fact, it leaked from 3 different points on the lamp and there was oil everywhere. What a mess!  I was attracted to this lamp because of the wide base and the ability to hang it.

"At 62 I have been a lifelong big wave surfer and a very strong long distance swimmer (2-3 miles per day 4-5 days/week). I am 5' 11'' tall, with a 31'' inseam, 38-40&#34; waist, 46-47&#34; chest, 52&#34; around my shoulders, and 34&#34; arms with only 13.5&#34; biceps. I gained a lot of weight last year so 3 months ago I hooked up a harness in my pool and lost 20 lbs. swimming 1-3 miles per day in a NeoSport XSpan 3/2mm 2XXL full wetsuit.  Now at 227 lbs I am aiming for about 205-210 lbs. by spring, but the water temp cooled to 68 degrees and the 3/2mm wetsuit was no longer sufficiently warm. Water was flushing in my neck and back quite a bit.  I first layered a 1.5mm neoprene shirt under my 3/2mm wetsuit and got more warmth and less flushing, but arm flexibility was compromised.<br />I decided to test the following 3 backzip wetsuits, and I really hoped the Hyperflex Voodoo would be my best choice for swimming in waters that might hit around 45 degrees;<br /><br />1.  Hyperflex Voodoo 4/3mm XXL (LFS)<br />2.  O'Neill Epic 4/3mm XXL (GBS)<br />3.  O'Neill HEAT 4/3mm XXL (LFS)<br />4.  Quiksilver Syncro 5/4/3mm XXL (LFS)<br /><br />1. Hyperflex Voodoo 4/3mm XXL (LFS) My first shock was that  the Voodoo was the hardest suit to put on by far (even over a thin lycra bodysuit) partly because of the non-slip fleece lining, but also because the arms were very tight on my skinny arms, and the suit was extremely tight around my shoulders. I had to have help pulling the floodgate over my head, and zipping the suit up.  I am surprised I did not feel terribly choked by the floodgate or by the wetsuit neck when zipped up. Even though the tightness in the shoulders was stretching the neck piece a little, the neck piece still remained comfortably snug.  Over all I felt like I was in a 5mm standard 50% flex neoprene wetsuit rather than a 100% stretch suit. This XXL was terribly restrictive of my shoulders and arms, and it felt like I feared a XXL-Short wetsuit might feel.  I knew I'd be warm in this suit even in 45-50 degree water, and I'd have very little if any water flushing, but I could not imagine swimming 1/2 mile in this suit even after wearing it for over an hour indoors because if the lack of flexibility in the arms and shoulders.<br /><br />2.  O'Neill Epic 4/3 mm XXL (GBS)<br />AND<br />3.  O'Neill HEAT 4/3mm XXL-short (LFS)<br /><br />The 2 O'neill suits both went on extremely easily, which shocked me, and both fit me absolutely perfectly even thought the HEAT was a 2XL-Short and the Epic just an XXL.  I purposely didn't stretch the Epic 4/3mm out when I put it on though it would have stretched out a bit in length in the legs if I needed it to. The HEAT fit me perfectly EVERYWHERE.  The Neoprene in both suits was absolutely buttery, and both felt far more flexible than the Voodoo 4/3mm or than a NeoSport Xspan 5mm had felt a month earlier.  The heat retention of the front panel in both suits was immediately evident.  The Liquid Fluid Seal over all the seams on the HEAT 4/3mm suit were totally stretchy, and the added back heat panels convinced me I would be significantly warmer in the Heat 4/3mm than in the Epic 4/3mm suit with GBS seams.  My only initial complaint with both O'neill suits was that the shape of the neck put a little pressure on the front of my throat - perhaps because my posture is not great and I stand with my head tilted forward a little (genetic trait) - but this issue became completely unnoticeable once I took the Heat 4/3mm and then the Epic 4/3mm into the water.<br /><br />4.  Quiksilver Syncro 5/4/3mm XXL (LFS) - For a cold water suit, this would have been my second choice behind the O'neill HEAT with LFS. It went on easily even with the back floodgate, and I was able to zip it up without help from my wife. The Neoprene felt absolutely wonderful and stretchy, the seams were Liquid-Fluid Sealed and not just GBS seams, and the suit felt totally comfortable once zipped up.  My arms and shoulders had easy and full range of motion and I knew I could swim miles warmly in this suit.  My only issue and reason for spending $70 more on the O'neill HEAT was that the QuikSilver Syncro 2XL was at least 3 inches too long for me in the legs because I have shorter legs and a longer torso.  The arms were also a little long for me, bulging a little around my biceps, but fitting snugly and sealing well at my wrists and all the way up my forearms. If I lose the 20 lbs. the O'neill HEAT XXLS will still fit me well, but the Quiksilver Syncro XXL would then become way too loose.<br /><br />My wife watched me try on and compare each suit, and since the O'neill HEAT 4/3mm obviously fit me the best and had the features I needed to swim long distances in cold water, after trying on the other suits I immediately made my decision and kept the O'neill HEAT 4/3mm suit on.  I threw on some 5mm NeoSport booties, donned a swim cap and 3mm Neosport gloves, stepped down into a pool of 58 degree water (not feeling the slightest chill), hooked myself into the swimming harness and immediately went face first into the water to swim a mile.  Only my cheeks were a little chilled at first. I felt NO water getting in through the neck, or the seams of my O'neill HEAT wetsuit. I felt No Chill at all !!!  In fact, after about a quarter mile I pulled down on the front collar to let in a little water in to cool me down in the suit.<br /><br />After loving the O'Neill Heat, and looking at the recommended water temperature range of 45 degrees and up, I decided to try the O'Neill Epic 4/3mm GBS in the water. I jumped into the 58 degree water and felt a little more cooling water seeping in than with the HEAT, but I was warmed up from the mile swim so I decided to swim another 1/2 mile.  I decided to keep the O'neill Heat 4/3mm for cold waters 45 degrees and up, the O'neill Epic 4/3mm for 56-57 degrees and up, and my Neosport XSpan 3/2mm would for waters 68 degrees and up.<br /><br />I  hope this free personal testimony about these wetsuits helps you make your next decision about the wetsuit that is right for you.",0.9986,1345,31.27906976744186,4.5,3.6495800000000003
"At 62 my hair is not very long and it is thinning, and this cap just doesn't want to stay where I first put it.

"I love these booties more than I thought I would.  I couldn't really tell how high quality they were from the Amazon ad, but they are well made.  The stitching is consistent and strong, and the bottom sole is very thin but durable and very flexible.  I am a size 11 so I bought the Large size so I can wear these alone, but then I found that more often than not I first put on my more expensive size 11 NeoSport hi-top pull on booties (2mm or 5mm)  before I pull on my Neosport 3/2mm Xspan Wetsuit.  Then I put these Freehawks on and cinch them snug with the 2 (not just one) Velcro straps on each bootie. Sometimes I wear the Freehawks mostly for extra padding over my heel when I'm going to use my training fins with the adjustable straps, or when I use my SEAC fins that have a fixed size heel which has stretched out a little over time and made them a size 12.  Other times I wear the Freehawks for buoyancy when I'm going to do an endurance swim and I just want to work my upper body and let my feet float behind me. I use them every swim.",0.8954,226,28.25,0.6,2.44862
I love these Neosport 2mm neoprene socks with traction soles.  As the water got colder I put these on over my lycra-spandex bodysuit and then into my full-length 3mm/2mm Neosport Xspan Wetsuit and they are great.

In the spring and summer I'll wear these alone just to keep my fins fitting perfectly.,0.9382,81,20.25,0.2,2.34146
"This XXL fit me well at 5' 11'' tall and 230 lbs with a 38'' waist but a 44'' gut, and 47'' chest. It was so comfortable on top, but my legs from just above my knees to my feet are a little more slender than the rest of me and cold water could enter.  That's the only reason for 4 stars - they expect guys who are big on top to have  massive thighs as well.  And so to solve the problem I ordered a full Neosport Xspan 3/2mm wetsuit so I would not have cold water coming up my legs to my core, and I am so happy with the NeoSport full wetsuit and the NeoSport accessories I bought to extend my lap-swimming season in my outdoor Atlanta pool.",0.973,144,36.0,0.0,1.8919000000000001

"This Neosport XSPAN 3/2mm Men's Wetsuit fits me almost perfectly, and that is amazing.  I didn't naturally trim down this past spring after putting on all the holiday weight last fall and winter.  I was 5' 11'' tall, with a 38'' waist, covered by a 44'' gut, and a 47'' chest. I have fairly broad shoulders but not very thick shoulders or biceps.  Out of the box, from chest down to my ankles this wetsuit fit me perfectly.  I just have just a very little extra room in the shoulders and biceps area.  The Neosport Xspan Neoprene is so unbelievably comfortable compared to the material in an H20 shorty, a Mares shorty, the comparable O'neil full wetsuit, and the Zoot Triathalon wetsuits that I tried on thanks to Amazon Prime. The extra room around my shoulders and biceps has made swimming for long distances much easier (in a harness in my 68 degree lap pool). There is no chafing at all.  I also wear a 20 Lb. Gold's Gym Weighted Vest over this wetsuit to counteract the flotation of the suit so I'm a little deeper in the water for a tougher workout - an hour long swim. The pounds are coming off and I am hoping my next wetsuit will be the XL size of this same wetsuit by the time it's too cold to swim in my pool in late November or December, unless I go to the XL in the thicker 5mm XSPAN Neoprene to keep swimming all winter.  I'll definitely keep this wetsuit for my heavier weight seasons, and the next one for my more trim size.  I also loved that the NeoSport accessories all fit perfectly; the Premium 5mm Hi Top Zipper Boots (11), the Premium 2mm Hi Top Socks (11), the Premium Neoprene 5mm 5-finger XL Gloves, and the Premium 5/3mm XXL Vented Bib Hood.",0.9953,356,25.428571428571427,0.0,2.29859

Since I don't have the receipt I might have to get it exchanged or store credit, neither of which I want. All I can say is that I'm lucky I didn't buy this out of town on some longer camping trip farther away.<br /><br />With my experience with coleman, between tents and this headlamp, it seems to be hit or miss.

"I love this case.  It's the easiest waterproof case to put on an iphone I've ever had.  It comes in two simple pieces...front and back. The back is clear just like the front, but it fits quite simply onto the front section and the two seal together by pressing it all around with your thumb.  I've called family members who tell me the sound quality is good, not muffled. The case comes with a wrist strap, a lanyard for wearing it around your neck, a screen cloth and an instruction booklet. Very nice package and excellent price.  I'm thrilled with this case. My biggest problem is dropping my phone and this rubber bumper around the edge is perfect for protecting it. The bumper extends enough on front and back to protect the screen.  There's also a bumper around the light and the camera lens. At first I had a little trouble getting the Home button to respond, but with a few tries, that problem disappeared. I guess it just needed to stretch the plastic a bit.

"After a lot of tough searching for the perfect sleeping bag, I finally found it. Back story - I started my own pet sitting business and occasionally I get swamped, which is a good thing. I make a majority of my income performing &#34;overnights,&#34; which is where I stay at the client's house so their pets feel safe and comfortable. When I first started I would sleep in the bed they assigned to me then spend my last day rushing around, doing laundry, so I could leave them with a freshly made bed. This was fine when I wasn't busy but things have picked up and I'm always pressed for time. The sleeping bag I ordered from Sleepingo allows me to either sleep on top of the clean bed or even on the sofa, if it's comfortable. No more doing laundry - I just pack my bed up and leave. The main reason I chose this bag was because it looked kind of &#34;thin.&#34; I'm in temperature controlled houses, not hiking up a mountain. Oddly enough, it's just always the perfect temperature - I don't get it?? I don't sweat in it during the warmer days and it keeps me plenty cozy when it's cold. In the T.M.I. category, if you don't happen to sleep in a lot of pj's, this bag doesn't &#34;stick&#34; to you if you happen to go to bed sweaty after walking dogs. I'm thrilled I found this bag and I'm honestly thinking of getting another to use at home. It's so soft inside, I don't want to get up!",0.9841,330,23.571428571428573,0.4,2.41523

Which is a win in my book.<br />It's a nice hat and it reversable.  You can fold it up so it can go in the suitcase or backpack and overall it looks great.",0.9783,118,29.5,0.0,2.29349

It has 5 clubs, a driver, hybrid, 7 iron,  pitching wedge, and putter.  It also had a glove, towel a few balls and tees.  The bag and clubs looked to me like they were good quality.  The bag has a stand incorporated into it and a backpack type sling so he can carry the clubs.<br />He went to his golf lesson and his instructor confirmed they were a very good set of clubs for him.  If you are looking for a good set of clubs for your kids or grandkids to use, this is definitely worth considering.",0.9858,187,20.77777777777778,0.0,2.29574
"We have a gazebo on our deck with screens and I've been using a floor fan to get some  air movement.  The problem with the floor fan is that it needs to be plugged in, it's big and it moves too much air.  When I saw this I thought it would be ideal.<br />The thing somes nicely packaged with two fan blades a remote and along USB cable for charging.  I put the blades on the motor and turned it on.  I didn't have to charge it up, it came with enough charge to use it for a while, which I always appreciate.  There are two lights on either side of the motor which are bright enough for what I need and also has 3 levels so you have options.<br />It moves a lot of air.  Of course, not as much as an electric floor fan, but that's what I needed.  The battery life is also good enough for what we need.  I don't sit in the screen room for 8 hours, so it has plenty of power for my needs.<br />It's a cool little fan and if you are looking for someting for a gazebo or tent or even an RV, this would work well.",0.9549,240,26.666666666666668,0.0,2.28647
"If you go fishing, you lose lures so you can never have too many of them.

I haven't used them yet, but they appear to be well made and hopefully are attractive to the fish.<br />I'll be taking these to Canada in a month or so and put them to the test.

I'm not a serious enough golfer to use spikes, I just golf in my gym shoes but if you need the scraper it is very well made and had a zinger so you can keep it on your bag.<br />All in all, it's a nice set.",0.8898,118,29.5,0.0,2.26694
"Well, I wanted a wide brimmed hat and this is definitely a BIG hat.  I burn easily in the sun and baseball caps just don't offer protection for your face and neck at the same time.  I got this for an upcoming fishing trip because I'm out on the lake all day with no shade.  I thought this would be good and it definitely keeps the sun off of me, front and back.  I wore it most of the day yesterday doing yard work and while it looked goofy  it certainly did the job.  It came folded up as you can see from the first pic, and that is good for packing it away, but having a big crease in the brim makes it look strange.<br />After wearing it all day, I finally figured out how to bend it so that the crease goes away and it doesn't look as goofy.<br />If you are looking for a wide brimmed hat, definitely consider this one.  It is well made and keeps the sun off.  It has a small strap to go under your chin because it will definitely blow away if you don't keep it tied down.<br />Overall it's good and I'll be wearing it a lot this summer.  I thought I was going to have to have it ironed out to get rid of the crease, but just a little folding does the trick.",0.965,268,29.77777777777778,0.4,2.4095
"I've got a bunch of these things to hold my glasses, but I didn't have anything that was floating so I decided to get these.  They are decent quality and hold the glasses well. One thing, they have a small plastic tube that goes over the end of the earpiece and that is find for my glasses, but might be small for glasses with larger end pieces.<br />They are a good length and can be adjusted for fit.  Overall, they are good to wear while fishing or boating.",0.9274,102,25.5,0.0,2.27822
"This kit is actually better quality than I thought it would be.  I really just needed the pliers and lip gripper, but since this was all in a package, I decided to get the whole kit.<br />It comes with the pliers, a gripper, a clipper/knot tool, a zinger, a folding net and a pair of gloves, so it's a nice package and would be good as a gift.<br />The folding net is pretty sturdy and folds together easily.  It is about 3 feet from the tip of the net to the end of the handle when extended.  The net is plascic or soft rubber and that is good for not harming the fish.  The net itself is 15 inches wide at the top and about 6 inches wide at the bottom and is 15 inches from front to back.  It would be good for panfish, bass or even trout.  It has a clip on the handle so you can put it on your belt, but I'm not sure how that would work out.  In any event, it's a nice net.<br />The pliers are very good, they have a sheath and a wrist strap and the lip grabber is also good.  The clipper and knot tool are also well made and the zinger is a nice one that extends out about 12-15 inches.  it has a carabiner type thing that you can use to attach to a belt loop.<br />It also comes with a pair of gloves with the thumb and two finger ends cut out.  They are lightweight and seem to be ok, although I've never seen fishing gloves with the fingers cut out.<br />All in all, it's a nice kit and most likely was designed for bass and panfish.  I'll use the lip grabber and pliers when I go to Canada fishing for large northern, but the rest of it I'll keep for fishing in the local ponds.",0.9936,372,31.0,0.1,2.32808

The Swim Team Logo is great and the USA on the back is a bonus.  I ordered an XL and it fits as expected.  Overall this is a great shirt.<br />I'm taking off one star because I think it's a little expensive for what it is.

Before I went, I tried them out and the spring fell out, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars.  I put the spring back in place and they worked fine during the 5 days of fishing.  I used these as well as pliers and so didn't use them all the time, but when I used them they were very good.  The spring never came out again, and I was a bit cautious at first but once I fixed them they worked great",0.9427,120,24.0,0.1,1.9128100000000001

I tried for about 15 minutes to get the thing inflated with no luck.  I finally got it partially inflated and it was unstable to sit on.  Maybe these things are meant for windy days or maybe this is just a cheap knock off (I don't know since it's the only one I've seen), but it's not something I would recommend.  The concept is great and maybe if the material were a bit lighter it would work better.  Basically this is kind of a canvas material with plastic sewn into it to hold air.",0.8753,146,20.857142857142858,0.2,1.1225900000000002

I won't be able to use it on a fish until next year, but the quality is great and it looks good.  I've tried it out on a few items around the house like a camera bag that weighed 12 pounds and it held.  I just grabbed on to the edge of the bag to see how it works and it held fine.  I like the lanyard as well and will do an update after I use it next summer.",0.9633,126,21.0,0.0,2.28899
"I just got back into photography after many years of point and shoot.  I had always liked hanging my camera at my side rather than having it stick out in front and so I started looking for a strap that would do just that.  I found the Op/Tech strap and really like it a lot.  It has two of those snap attachments built in and both of them slide around on the sling.  That way you can move the camera up to a shooting position without having to re-arrange the strap.  I haven't found a use for the second one yet, so it is just hanging there, but it's so small and light that it doesn't matter.<br />I have a Nikon d5300 and when I attach it to this sling it feels like I'm not even wearing a camera strap.  The sling takes distributes almost all the weight of the camera so that I can wear it for hours without strain of any kind.<br />If you are looking for a sling, this is one to consider.  I haven't found any issues with it yet and have been using it regularly for several months.",0.7285,217,27.125,0.1,2.24855
We have used 2 of these covers for our ski boat.  It is a good alternative to an expensive custom cover.  It keeps the sun off the seats and rain out while on the lift.  We have found leaving our inflated tow tubes under the front and the back of the boat keep the rain from collecting.  In the winter it is a great cover to keep the dust and dirt out while at indoor storage.  For the price I don't mind getting a new one every 2 years.  I would not plan on towing with it attached.  It would stretch and most likely shorten it's lifespan.,0.6808,117,14.625,0.0,2.20424

I think the Fitbit branded ones break easily, too, so I only knocked off one star.<br /><br />**NOTE: If you have very small wrists (my thumb and pointer finger touch around my wrist), it's important to note these don't fit the same as Fitbit branded bands. They're bigger in that the straight part that goes across the top of your wrist is longer.

"I had a Fitbit One, which I loved, and I lost it running a charity 5k. I couldn't justify spending $100 on a new one that I would probably lose again, so I got this one. I hate it. Don't waste your money. I tested it many, many times, both by counting my steps and checking it and while walking with friends who have the One and Flex, and it does not accurately count your steps.

"I got this vest last year and didn't use it much as my puppy didn't seem to like it.  I'm not sure I realized it then but it was too big.  He was only about 6 lbs last winter but this winter he's 11lbs and it fits just right. It's great as you can use the hooks for the leash and it actually controls him better than a harness.  It seems to help most on cold mornings where there is frost on the ground, it protects his little tummy since he's not very far off the ground.  It is now starting to feel a little snug (he's reached 12lbs) so I think it is best sized for a dog that is about 10lbs.",0.9718,139,23.166666666666668,0.1,1.92154

"Ahh, SOG.  I have many knives in the EDC (everyday carry) rotation.  I mostly prefer Spyderco as their designs and materials are preferred in my use.  I am not new to SOG, however.  I've owned EDCs and fixed blades that have been incredible values and exceptional users.  When I saw several SOG manufactured blades on Amazon this Holiday season for sale I thought it a prime opportunity to try out a few more examples.  Which brings me to the Trident.<br /><br />This is the black box version of the Trident.  It's not the full retail packaged item, but rather comes in a generic looking manufacturer's box from SOG.  I could care less about the retail box, so that's a non-issue.  What is an issue is the genuine disappointment upon opening and trying out the folder for the first time.  When comparing this item to other EDC blades from not only other manufacturers but SOG themselves the whole thing just comes across kind of &#34;meh&#34;.  I know this is an older design from the outfit, but it may be time to retire it. Despite it's lightweight, the knife just comes across bulky.  I could maybe give it a pass because of the 3.75&#34; blade, but the handle doesn't fit well in the hand and can be likened to carrying a 2x4.  Alright, that's a little far, but it's just an uncomfortable design to me.  Further inspection and this knife at the very least had some care taken in the build.  There is absolutely perfect blade centering in this particular example.<br /><br />Upon flicking open this massive 3.75&#34; blade, you want to be impressed.  The Trident fires off a little slow, though.  If you've ever held an AEGIS or Flashback you know how some of these SOG assisted openers can snap with real authority.  The Trident isn't one of them.  As for the steel, it's AUS-8, which isn't a super steel by any means but it's adequate in this application.  Extremely sharp out of the box which had sometimes been a problem with SOG in the past.  I'm not thrilled with the blade shape, though, not in my uses.  This is definitely more hiking folder than everyday use.  The pocket clip is a reversible low carry and sufficiently retains tight to the pocket, but I'm not fond of the way the whole thing carries.  Again, a bit too much bulk in the dimensions.  While we're on the handle again, the glass reinforced nylon that this is built from is too slick.  The gimping on top that leads to the blade is also not deep enough or poorly designed which causes thumb slip.  Why it's on the blade is a mystery, as those notches in retaining a firm grip are even less useful than the ones on the handle.  They need to either be deeper or more aggressive.  Probably both as they're too rounded and just cause slip.<br /><br />Another feature is the lock.  I find them redundant and wish SOG offered knife varieties without them, but there it is and I just leave it off.  The Trident is also known for its &#34;rope cutting&#34; notch in the handle.  I didn't try this feature out, but see it as a means to snagging on items and not lending itself a true benefit.  Perhaps I'm wrong on that, though, and I have no field use with that particular feature.<br /><br />I wanted to like the Trident.  It's lightweight, a long blade, and a well-crafted folder.  I just find myself dwelling on all of its shortcomings instead.  I paid a greatly reduced cost on this leading up to Christmas.  It was supposed to be a gift to my cousin.  Even at the reduced cost I think I'm going to send it back.  The whole product just comes across as barely adequate and there's just better folders out there in every category of use.  SOG even makes better carry knives with the Flashback and Aegis lines.  The Trident is just a miss from them in my opinion.  Choose something else, you'll be happy you did.",0.9892,827,18.795454545454547,0.3,1.5867600000000002
"The Helinox.  What can I say?  It's a wonder chair when camping with a pack.  If you've ever been out in the wilderness, you'll understand having a creature comfort that gets you off the ground from time to time is sometimes priceless.  The build materials and design are outstanding.  Big Agnes has designed the fabric to be more durable in the wear areas, while shaving weight elsewhere.  The seat width is also perfectly comfortable. Comes with a little bag that easily allows the chair to be packed.  If there's one negative, it comes in the price.  Those that hike, though, can understand quality, weight, and price are areas that have give and take.  You get a great quality item that's generally lightweight (ultralight packers won't have a chair anyways, but for those like myself that appreciate a couple comforts this is quite manageable) but you're going to spend a few bucks on it.<br /><br />It's traveled on two hike trips with me thus far and I've enjoyed pulling it up near the campfire at night.  I'd gladly purchase this chair again in a heartbeat.",0.9771,223,18.58333333333333,0.2,2.35313
"SOG has been in the industry a long time.  They offer an affordable value in the knife world.  They constantly try to innovate and carry Lifetime Warranties on their products.  Some of their designs are fantastic.  Some are duds.  The Flashback is an awesome every day carry folder that is nearly perfect but just misses shy.  I still managed to pick up this straight clip model as well as a tanto version.<br /><br />Packaging: This is the black box version.  Not the retail box version.  It doesn't matter, you get the same knife in both boxes but one doesn't have a clear window to view the blade and the other is just a black manufacturer's box that says SOG.  It's not about the box, it's about what's inside.<br /><br />First glance: This thing screams cool.  I just love the color scheme, look of the blade, the total design reminds me of a slick silver on black race car set up.  The clip is reversible, but already comes in my preferred carry designation.  It rides deep in the pocket and retains firmly to the pocket.  I haven't had one instance of it coming loose or getting hung up on seatbelts or the like in my daily use.<br /><br />Picking it up: I believe SOG advertises these Flashback knives around 3.8 oz.  It feels heavier, but I don't have a scale to confirm.  Either way, it's fairly light.  Disable the safety, and then never use it again.  I'm actually of the mindset SOG should just delete their safeties on most of their assisted folders, but your mileage may vary.  If it gives you a warm fuzzy to use it, then do so.  I think it just takes away from the attractiveness of the design and is unnecessary.  First use flicking it open and you realize SOG really meant this thing was fast.  It opens authoritatively, too, so hold on to it.  Snaps into a firm lock position and is ready to use.  The blade is AUS-8 steel and comes hair shaving sharp out of the box.  AUS-8 is OK, but I wish SOG would use some better steels in their builds.  It'll be fine for the use of everyday carry, however.  I'm not a huge Tanto fan, but I had to have that model in addition to this straight clip Flashback I picked up due to how much I liked the straight clip after carrying a few days.  The Tanto was supposed to be a gift, but I think I'm keeping it, too.  As for the grip, you can get a firm purchase on the blade as a result of the aggressive gimping.  I think SOG nailed this one unlike some of their other designs.  It fits my hand so well and provides a level of confidence in use as result.<br /><br />Build Quality: Now here's where things get tricky.  SOG is a mass market knife maker.  Meaning they pump them out, check on the quality so often, and use cheap labor to build it.  One example can be outstanding in build and the next will be ok for the value.  The tanto I received has perfect blade centering.  The straight clip model is off to one side.  Both are well built, but inherent in a lot of SOG designs there is some side-to-side play in each once the blade is in the locked position.  It has something to do with their locking design as it was also inherent in the Aegis I've previously owned.  This is where I knock these knives down a star as others in the same price category like Cold Steel and Spyderco don't have these issues.<br /><br />Overall: I love carrying this knife.  I do prefer the straight clip blade design and would recommend that to purchasers as the blade shape is more useful, at least to me.  I still had to have this tanto version in addition.  There are some caveats that come in the mass-produced build quality, but if you want a well-built everyday folder that has a solid value than you shouldn't be disappointed in the Flashbacks from SOG.  I would suggest shopping around a bit and making sure you do get the best price, however, as these can fluctuate.  With a few shortcomings, this still comes as a recommended buy.",0.999,844,19.181818181818183,0.2,1.9597000000000002

"My son (age 9) wanted a Slack Line for Christmas.  We opted for the Slack Rack for two reasons.  (1) Can be used indoors for cold rainy months.

Although by then, he may want a traditional slackline<br /><br />It is expensive but it is a quality product and with Amazon - it includes free shipping.",0.9109,151,18.875,0.4,2.3932700000000002
"I have tried several types of toy bows for my 4 boys (ages 6, 7, 9, 11) and have had all broken - some the very first day.  I am thrilled to say this cross bow has lasted.  Also my youngest is strong enough to use this one (he's the one that actually asked for this toy).  We have the compound bow made by air storm and he isn't strong enough to pull it back.<br /><br />I like this crossbow style because they can load it and then find their target then just pull trigger.<br /><br />The &#34;arrow&#34; is very sturdy.  You get 6 of them.  It does fly FAST!  The suction cups usually stick to wall then fall a few seconds later.  They suction cup end isn't very domed.  Still sticks long enough to keep score if that is what you are doing.",0.4922,185,20.55555555555556,0.0,2.14766

"I used one of these floor peddle bikes in rehab and they really were nice to strengthen my legs, I have very weak legs because I have to sit so much.<br />This machine is whisper quite and peddles so smooth, the only complaint that I have, and it's a big one for me, there is no handle on top to pick it up to move it, you have to lift it by the legs and that tips the machine up and the back rubber feet that are still on the floor flit around so then they have to be adjusted to sit properly on the floor again.<br />I am 76 and this weighs around 10 pounds so a handle on top would make this over a 5 star rating, it's VERY awkward to move around.",-0.3051,152,152.0,0.1,1.5384700000000002

"I am loving this machine, although I think I must have bought the last one because they have posted a notice  that they are out of stock and not sure if they will be restocking.  I sure hope they do, because this machine does it all.<br />If you read the posts from others that have bought this, it is VERY true that you DO NOT tighten the screws in the bottom of the platform before they are all in place or thing just will not line up and you will get the job of taking all the bolts and screws back out and starting over, like we had to.<br />I love the programs that come with the machine especially the P1  we use that the most.  I have not figured out how to program the ones by our self that is an option because we have only had the machine about 1 week.<br />I love love love the two arm bands(belts) that come with it, they attach to the rings on the foot plate and  have velcro on them for adjustment, when you stand on the plate the bands go from the sides of you feet and you hold them in each hand with a nice handle. and boy do your arms and you upper body  get a good workout. I told my husband I feel like I need to wear a helmet so I don't get whip lash.<br />You do need to place the machine either on a floor or cement, not on carpet, we had ours on the carpet at first and I was upstairs in the bedroom when my husband first tried it out and I thought we were having an earthquake, the whole house shook,  it really improved the vibration when we put it on the wood floor.<br />As for the SMELL. it does have a rubber car tire smell to it and it is quite strong, I am hoping that it will leave soon, but in the mean time I have the machine on the main floor in a small bedroom and I put a heavy doubled up piece of fabric over it when we are not using it and I have an air freshener in the room so we don't smell it at all.<br />I am really glad we have this machine, the one thing my husband noticed already, is that he had pain in his feet from nerve damage and it would really be painful at times especially at night when he was sleeping but since he has been using the machine this past week he hardly has any pain at all.<br />I HATE exercise and never do it, I use this twice a day for 10 min each so this is going to be life changing for me.

"So, for the first time that I can recollect, it's flipping FREEZING in Georgia. In November! I was born last century, closer to the middle than the end, and I swear I don't recall it ever being this daggum cold in Georgia at Thanksgiving. I remember wearing shorts and sweating MANY Thanksgivings. Most Thanksgivings, actually. The thing about cold weather, for me, is once my feet get cold, only running them under hot water for about 5 minutes warms them back up. I usually only have to deal with that kinda cold a couple of months, January through March, and Im usually just fine dealing with it. Welp, the cold came early and so I wanted thick, comfortable, warm socks. Less polyester and more wool. Something reminiscent of slouchy socks from the mid80s. (GADDDDDD I MISS THICK COTTON SLOUCHY SOCKS 😭). These are what I landed on after half an hour of looking through Amazon and they were like a lightning deal or something. They arrived, I laundered them and there has legit not been a day since that I have not worn these socks. I keep them cycling through my washing machine, so it will be interesting to see how long they last. Still... 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",0.7976,241,16.066666666666666,0.0,2.23928

"I have a FB friend who swears by her FitBit Force (which I understand is no longer available), so I thought I would compare FitBit models and get the one that was right for me.  Not only did the FitBit One have more features that appealed to me, but the reviews were resoundingly more positive, so I figured I would give it a try.  It came early this morning via UPS, I've already given it a good full charge, read all the pertinent information on the website, and have a solid understanding (I believe) of what I needed to do - and have done - to set it up and get to using it.  Right off the bat I began counting my steps:  The first 30 steps recorded as 84 steps.  Ten more steps (which put me at 40) recorded as (a new total of) 106.  It does say STEPS, not feet.  Hmm.  Will definitely add to this update, but it looks like a cheapy $5 pedometer would have been as accurate for step count (heck, I think Google and Apple have apps available for free that couldn't be worse - I mean, this thing was wayyy off!).

"I have a couple of these in different sizes and colors  and absolutely love them all.!!<br /><br />Over the past nine months or so everyone, even strangers ask where I got the bottle, and are immediately impressed when they look at the selections. I get them to say what they like and have been getting them a bottle for Their birthday. Its a nice surprise delivered directly to them. I recommend these for yourself and as gifts for loved ones.<br /><br /> I recently bought my Mom and Dad both a bottle since they are always on the go traveling during retirement.<br /><br />They absolutely love these.<br />Moms bottle had a small dent on the lip so it slowly dripped out no matter which lid she tried.<br /><br />Great customer service! I contacted the Seller and they put a replacement in the mail that day! I was asked to return the leaking bottle within 30 days or I would be charged for the new one. She had a new cup 2 days later.<br /><br /> The powder coating is great and makes bottle non slip<br />  These keep drinks hotter and colder than a few top of the line brands. Don't waste money, buy these<br />  The bottle having 2 different lids is great! Very handy. And lids have easy access loop for carrying the bottle with a finger or two.<br />  The smaller sizes fit in cup holders.<br />I put mine in the dishwasher, except for the one that I have dropped on ashphalt.

"One of my teenagers is about to graduate high school and is looking at colleges to attend. One possible choice is the University of Alabama and she has already planned a visit to the campus. Her interest in this well- known university was enough to convince me to get this University of Alabama Flag Crimson Tide Flag, from Desert Cactus.<br /><br />I didn’t check the dimensions of this flag before ordering, but suffice it to say that it’s a good size flag, bigger than I thought it would be. It is five feet wide and three feet tall. It depicts the large, capital A for Alabama and the words Crimson Tide, lest anyone have any doubt what school this flag represents.<br /><br />This flag is constructed from polyester and this fact is obvious when you touch it. The fabric is thin, so it may not seem like it is made to last. It can be displayed indoors or outdoors, and it should hold up as long as nothing gets hold of it. I say that because one of my dogs had her eyes on it and started to go after it for chewing purposes. Had I not been there to stop her, she would have easily ripped it. But other than an incident like this, the flag should hold up, even to harsh outdoor conditions.<br /><br />There are two holes on the corners of the flag where the words Crimson Tide are displayed. With these openings, you could attach the flag for display from a pole. I doubt this will ever happen with this flag. My teenager wants it for more basic use, hanging it from her bedroom wall, for example.<br /><br />Universities are the focal point of my life right now, with my senior looking at potential places to attend. This University of Alabama flag is a good one for students or fans of the Crimson Tide. It’s a good way to show your school spirit, whether as an attendee of the school, a parent of a student, or a fan of the school’s sports.",0.8789,414,27.6,0.0,1.8636700000000002
"I like to take short hikes and long hikes. My problem is that, for the longest time, all I had were large backpacks. For hikes/walks less than, say, 7 miles, there is no need for a large backpack. I finally solved my problem by getting this Rustic Lodge Bear Moose Deer Hiking Daypack from Fnqkmlep.<br /><br />Measuring about 15 inches in length, this crossbody daypack is just right when you have only a few items to carry. It has a main compartment with an additional pocket on the inside, plus a front pocket and mesh netting. The main pocket has two zippers that meet in the middle to keep it closed.<br /><br />You can use and wear this daypack different ways, but it is intended to be worn as a crossbody pack, which means around the neck on one side and under your arm on the other side. This helps hold it snugly, yet comfortably, against your body. You can wear it with the pack on your chest, or on your back. And the cool thing about a crossbody daypack is that you can easily move it from back to front and vice versa, making it easy to reach for the water, snacks, etc that you need.<br /><br />This daypack performs as expected. It has a fun, outdoors design pattern. It can be adjusted to fit your body and besides using it for day packing and hikes, it can certainly be used for other things, too, like carrying a small amount of school supplies. You just need to remember that the space is limited. A full set of schoolbooks, for example, will not fit in this pack.<br /><br />Long hikes require a large backpack loaded with sufficient water, food, and emergency supplies. Shorter, less strenuous hikes need only a minimal amount of food and drink. This daypack from Fnqkmlep is exactly what I need for my shorter hikes. It’s much more practical for simpler needs and is comfortable to wear. It’s an excellent choice for your mini-backpacking needs.",0.985,411,24.176470588235293,0.1,2.3255
"If you’re someone who wants a strength- based workout, you know that using weights is the normal and common way to go. If you don’t have weights, there is an alternative that some say is just as good, and that is using resistance bands like this set, sold by the Sanlan Store.<br /><br />With this set, you get multiple bands, a bar to hook them on, and a few accessories like ankle straps, handles, and a door anchor. The bands, colored yellow, green, red, blue, and black, offer different levels of resistance. You can start out low, with just a band or two, then gradually combine more bands for a more strenuous workout.<br /><br />Using resistance bands is something completely new to me and there are many good reasons to like this or even prefer this to using actual weights. The top reason is the ease of working out anytime, anyplace. Because there is no actual weight, you can take your carrying bag and bands most anywhere. They are lightweight and take up little space. You can then remove them from the bag, hook the bands to the bar, and begin your workout. I don’t really have any basis for comparison, since this is something new to me, but the bands are durable and made to last. I don’t have any worries that they will break, so I can workout with peace of mind.<br /><br />Some exercise bands are nothing more than bands, but this set comes complete with a bar, so it’s all set for you to use. Of course, you don’t have to use the bar- there are other exercises you can do that do not require the bar. But I like that the set has everything you need for a varied workout.<br /><br />Free weights, barbells, and dumbbells are still the most common way to weight train, but there is something to be said for using resistance bands instead. I feel safer using these bands than I do using free weights and I like that I can easily take them most anyplace. It’s a quality set and a good one for those who want to improve their physical fitness.",0.9911,448,32.0,0.6,2.0773300000000003
"Strength building is part of many exercise routines. To build muscle, you need to lift weights or otherwise add weight to your body in some way. Dumbbells are a good way to accomplish this and a good option for those who want to lift their weight is this set of Adjustable Dumbbells, from Vivitory.<br /><br />I’ve used many dumbbells in my day, but this is the first time I have ever had a set that was adjustable. You adjust the weight by removing or adding steel bars and by doing this, you can reduce the weight down to about 5.5 pounds each or even less if you leave off the caps. The maximum weight for each dumbbell is about 18 pounds with all the rods in place. This is enough weight range to make these dumbbells using for many strength- building routines.<br /><br />Removing and adding the weights to these dumbbells takes time, so don’t go into this thinking it’s going to be quick and simple. It will take effort, but it’s still simple enough that most people wont mind. The reason it takes some effort is because you also have to make sure the pads are in place, otherwise the steel rods will move around while you do your workout.<br /><br />These dumbbells are easy to grip and they look better than traditional dumbbells, which feature free weights. The colorful appearance is cool, not that this means much for working out, but it does look nicer, less industrial/rugged than the traditional style. And the bars hold in place well- you don’t need to worry that they will fall out while you use the dumbbells.<br /><br />Strength building is important to those who exercise. A good set of dumbbells can make strength building easier and If you’re the type who doesn’t want to mess with free weights, you might consider this dumbbell set from Vivitory. It’s a good set for those who want a single set of dumbbells for their workout routine.",0.9938,400,33.333333333333336,0.2,1.9581400000000002
"One easy way to get more bang for your exercise buck is to add weights to your ankles or wrists. The added weight helps build strength and it’s as simple as strapping weights around your limbs. A choice that is as good as any is this set of weights from Toolest.<br /><br />Each of these weights is one pound. That makes it light enough that it won’t be too noticeable, but also heavy enough to produce the desired results. To use them, just wrap them and fasten the Velcro strap. If you want to be really ambitious, you could purchase a pair and place them on both the wrists and ankles.<br /><br />These weights fit anyone and they hold in place well thanks to the Velcro seal. Made sure you don’t try to slip your hand or foot through what appears to be an open loop. My young teenager thought that was how she was supposed to wear these at first and she has small enough hands that she made it work. Most people’s hands and feet are far too big to even try this, but when you first look at the weights, it does look like this is what you’re supposed to do. It works much simpler than that. Just take the full weight and wrap it in place. If you’re unsure if you’re wrapping in the correct direction, you will know as soon as you try to fasten the Velcro. If it won’t fasten, flip the weight around and try it the other way.<br /><br />With the triangle design, these weights look better than other, similar weights. You should be able to see the triangles in full view when properly strapped. They hold snugly in place and there is no interference with your exercise routine. Just strap them on and start moving. They are very good ankle/wrist weights, and they give you an added edge in your exercise routine.",0.9886,385,22.647058823529413,0.5,2.44658
"A simple addition to anyone’s exercise routine is jumping rope. Any rope will do in a pinch, but it’s much better when you have a fancy rope made for the purpose and a rope that easily goes the extra mile is this Smart Jump Rope.<br /><br />What do you get with this jump rope? You get a rope that has electronic controls that tell you how many turns you make, how many minutes you jump, and the total calories burned. To make the setup complete, you program your weight in kilograms. You’re then ready to start jumping and improve your fitness.<br /><br />One of the interesting options with this jump rope is that you can perform the action without using the actual rope. This cordless option might sound unusual at first, but the idea is to jump off the ground with each turn of your wrists. You are still getting the same fitness as with a rope, without the annoyance of not clearing the rope with your feet and possibly getting tangled or tripping.<br /><br />Once you finish using this digital jumping rope just pack it up in the included storage bag until your next scheduled exercise time. If you’re a fitness freak who likes precise, scientific measurements, your next exercise time will likely be sooner than you think. I can’t speak for everyone, but I like anything that shows my statistics, and I am motivated to exercise more when I can see the facts like number of turns, total minutes, and calories burned.<br /><br />We could all use a little more exercise in our daily routine. This digital jump rope is an excellent way to better fitness and it’s the only jump rope I have ever used with digital readouts. Get one for yourself and improve your health.",0.9953,362,32.90909090909091,0.0,2.29859
"Those who like to do yoga will agree that it is best when performed on a mat made for this purpose. Mats are not all the same- some are certainly better than others and more suited to the task at hand. A good choice for yoga practitioners is this Yoga Mat from the YR Store.<br /><br />Unroll this mat from the package and you will notice that it is approximately 6 feet by 2 feet in size. The bottom is designed to grip the floor, so you don’t need to worry about sliding around. The top isn’t flat and smooth- it has indentions, that are like tiny grips and are deigned to make yoga more comfortable.<br /><br />The mesh storage bag that comes with this mat is useful. It provides a simple means to take it from place to place. If you need to clean, it’s best to just use a damp cloth. It shouldn’t get that dirty anyway. One issue that some people may have with this mat is its size. It isn’t long enough to accommodate taller individuals and it isn’t very wide, either. A few additional inches to the dimensions would be an improvement.<br /><br />Yoga is a popular practice. This yoga mat from the YR Store checks off the majority of the boxes that most would require in a yoga mat. Other than the size, it meets or exceeds most people’s minimum requirements.",0.9829,290,22.307692307692307,0.0,1.89487
"Backpacks are in great abundance in my home. I have an assortment of backpacks for the short hikes I take, but we also have them for other purposes. When I found myself in need of a backpack for one of my kids, I decided to get this Ennoven Backpack.<br /><br />This backpack is listed as a hiking or camping backpack and it would be fine for that purpose. My teenager decided instead to use it for school. It is medium in size, with a 30- liter capacity and it is large enough to hold a laptop computer, which is a big deal to most anyone nowadays. There are enough compartments to hold all the items she needs to haul around from class to class.<br /><br />The closure on this backpack is good and it seems like it is made to last. I checked the zippers and they seem strong and sturdy. There is nothing more annoying than to have a backpack zipper break on you or go off track and not be capable of an easy fix. The manufacturer seems like they have this aspect of the backpack under control.<br /><br />There are no issues with comfort when wearing this backpack. You may need to have someone else adjust it, while it’s on your back, to get it just right. Once the straps are in place, you’re ready to go. The back padding is nice, too. I can’t speak about the usefulness of this backpack for taking a hike or otherwise spending a good deal of time in the outdoors. But for school/work use, it more than does the job and is priced right.",0.9898,324,23.142857142857142,0.1,2.32694
"I like to go on short hikes and since my hikes usually vary from 3 to 10 miles, I prefer to have an assortment of backpacks to fit the need. One thing I lack is a lighter, smaller, more basic backpack and this need convinced me to add this CBRSports bag to my backpack collection.<br /><br />As for the size of this backpack, it is about what I expected. The 25 liter capacity makes it smaller than most of my other backpacks, but still large enough that it can handle what I need for a hike of a few hours. It doesn’t have tons of pockets and compartments. It is more basic, so it works well when basic is all I need. And it is easily foldable and lightweight, so you can store it most anyplace.<br /><br />This sports bag passes the size test for a short hike, but there are certain aspects of the design that bother me. The most annoying is the Velcro closure. Look at the top and you will see the Velcro strips. They are on opposite sides of the bag and to use them, the only way you can make them touch is to fold and roll the top. This is quite awkward and it made me wonder if I was doing something wrong. But this is how it works. You can barely get the Velcro strips to touch and even when they do, the security is not as good as it is with other bags.<br /><br />Another issue I have with this sports bag is the smell. It’s an odd chemical/petroleum type of smell and even after a few weeks of use, it is still present. If you like the scent of gasoline, then you may not mind but I don’t like it. I am hoping that maybe it will fade over time.<br /><br />For a medium sized backpack, this CBRSports bag is a decent option. It can help you carry your water and supplies for a jaunt in the woods and it’s easy to store. But with the awkwardness of the Velcro seal and the odd scent, this bag can only be rated average overall.",0.8992,429,25.235294117647054,0.0,1.4697600000000002
"If you like to do yoga, you need a good mat. You need something large enough to fit your full body no matter what the pose and you need something that stays firmly in place. A good mat for this purpose and for a fair price is this Primasole Yoga Mat with Carry Case.<br /><br />Measuring six feet by two feet, this yoga mat is designed to handle most anyone. Only those who are extraordinarily tall will not be able to use this mat. The other standout feature is the thickness. It is about one centimeter thick, so it’s comfortable on your body. And with the included carrying case, you can roll it up and take it with you, wherever you go. It’s lightweight and easily portable.<br /><br />Another cool fact about this yoga mat is that it holds itself in place. You don’t need to worry about slippage, and that is a very comforting thing. The bottom of the mat is incredibly good at gripping the floor, so there are no worries that you might find yourself taking a tumble due to the mat sliding on the floor.<br /><br />Primasole makes many good yoga mats and this one is certainly a good one for the price. Yes, there are better ones out there but at this price point, this mat is as good as any and it’s a great addition to your yoga routine.",0.9826,284,25.818181818181817,0.1,1.9247800000000002
"When you need a quick resistance workout, you can reach for a pair of dumb bells or other small, exercise equipment and start lifting. But if you want something lighter and simpler, you can reach for resistance bands like ZM-YOUTOO Resistance Bands Set.<br /><br />There is more than just a single band and single set of resistance levels with this set. There are five bands in all: One for 10 pounds, 20 pounds, 30 pounds, 40 pounds, and 50 pounds. You can combine them any way you like. Use them all and you would have 150 pounds of resistance, which is more than you get with most other workout bands like these.<br /><br />Among the added accessories in this set is a door anchor, which is helpful. You hook it on the other side of a door, close the door, and then use the bands. Most doors should have no trouble handling this, but I think it is best to use something a little sturdier. If you use a door, make sure to hook it on the side which the door opens toward and use the bands on the side opposite. You wouldn’t want to have the door suddenly open and the anchor come flying toward you. I’m not completely sure about the safety with the doors in my house, so I prefer to use something else. One possibility is to go to a playground, when kids are not present, and hook the bands to the monkey bars.<br /><br />As for durability, these bands are elastic and seem like they were made to last. They are made from latex and they stretch with ease and seem like they won’t wear out or break for a while. Only time will tell, but I see no issues with quality. They come with a carrying pouch also, so you can take them anywhere you go and since they are so light, it won’t be a problem at all to transport them from place to place.<br /><br />A quick, spontaneous workout has many benefits. You can’t easily take free weights or dumb bells anywhere you go, but you can easily take ZM-YOUTOO Resistance Bands most any place, for a fast and convenient workout. They help tone the legs, arms, etc without the excessive weight and they are engineered to last.",0.992,466,29.125,0.0,2.2976
"Exercise is important, as I am sure most would agree. But often, it isn’t practical to pay a visit to a nearby gym- you need something that is easily accessible and that you can take with you, wherever you go, for a quick workout. A good option for your workout needs is Portable Pilates Bar Kit with Premium & Upgraded 30LB Thick Resistance Bands.<br /><br />Pulled from the package, this workout equipment is ready to use. All you need to do is attach the ends of the workout bar. At this point, you can use the foot loops to hold it down, then start exercising. There are several different ways you can use this simple piece of equipment. It can be used to tone different muscle groups depending on how it is used.<br /><br />You do get a fairly good amount of resistance from this workout bar, but there is no way to control the level of resistance. You have to take it the way it is, since there is no way to adjust it, that I can see. It seems to work fine for basic needs. Once you have used it for a while, I would guess that will no longer be sufficient- it will get too easy and you will likely need something with greater resistance. In other words, this cannot take the place of the sophisticated workout equipment in a well- stocked gym. But the best part about it is that, since it is so small and compact, you can use it whenever you need it.<br /><br />The best way to utilize the Portable Pilates Bar is to find different ways to do the exercises. I recommend going online and looking for different exercises so that you can workout different muscle groups. It’s a nice, simple piece of exercise equipment and it is useful for those who are on the go and need something to encourage exercise anytime, anyplace.",0.995,378,27.0,0.2,1.9585000000000001
"Working out can involve many different types of equipment. I tend to prefer the workouts that need as little equipment as possible and jumping rope is a good way to workout using something that is simple and can be taken and used most anywhere. A good choice for your next jump rope workout is TINEMET Weighted Jump Rope.<br /><br />Weighing more than the typical jump rope, this heavier rope is not really a rope at all, and that is good because it can’t get tangled like an actual rope. It’s also easier to jump over than a traditional jump rope so you are less likely to trip while you use it. The cable glides across the floor with ease, in contrast to an actual rope which can sometimes cause friction when it touches the floor.<br /><br />There is more weight with this jump rope and you will notice it in the handles, which include a weight in each. If you like, you can unscrew the ends of the handles and remove the weights. I think it’s best to leave them in place, since the added weight can improve a workout. Besides, they are quite light and are certainly not heavy enough to make jumping rope uncomfortable. Another cool feature is that you can pull the rope through the handles and trim it down to size. This is great because it means that shorter individuals can adjust it to fit their needs.<br /><br />Jumping rope is a good activity to add to any workout. This TINEMET Weighted Jump Rope is a handy addition to your exercise needs. It glides and turns easily and the adjustable feature makes it usable by just about anyone. It’s a good gift idea for the exercise fans among your family and friends.",0.9928,345,26.53846153846154,0.0,1.89784
"Going on hikes is a regular way of life for me. If the hike is more than a few miles in length, then I must have a backpack loaded with the essentials, both for survival and for enjoyment. I want a backpack suitable for my lifestyle/desires and a backpack that provides what I need is the Pelican Elite Backpack Cooler.<br /><br />This backpack is different from others than I own and use. It has two compartments: an upper, 13 liter compartment and a lower, 5.4 liter compartment. The backpack is well insulated overall and is made with material that feels like that of a tent. It is well protected from the elements and you can feel confident that, wherever you go, the contents of your backpack will remain in workable/usable condition.<br /><br />What sets this backpack apart from most others is the bottom compartment. It is designed to hold canned beverages and it can hold up to eight cans, standing upright. This section is kept sealed by a heavy zipper that takes effort to open and close, but that provides peace of mind. The bottom section keeps beverages cold by way of its insulation, but I recommend adding an ice pack or two for the highest level of protection. As long as your ice pack is thin in design, it should work. And if you have items that need to be kept cold in the top compartment, then adding an ice pack there is also a good idea.<br /><br />This backpack straps on easily and is generally comfortable to use. It is more rigid than my other backpacks but also better insulated and better able to protect the contents from the elements. It is just right for people like me who tend to carry more food and drink in my backpack than anything else. I would like it If the top section was sealed more thoroughly with a heavy zipper similar to what you get with the bottom compartment. But this is still a useful backpack overall and one I like to use for my frequent day hikes in local parks.",0.9949,399,26.6,0.4,2.01847
"Bike riding is something I want to instill in my kids and it all starts with getting quality bicycles that will last a good long time without needing constant repair. I have had good success with certain brands, and among them is Mongoose. So, I quickly accepted the opportunity to get the Mongoose Title Elite Pro BMX Race Bike.<br /><br />This bicycle can be purchased pre- assembled, but there is very little involved in putting the few pieces together. There are instructions inside the included owner’s manual, but the assembly is very intuitive and I didn’t even need to look at the step by step instructions. In no time at all, the bicycle was assembled and ready for use.<br /><br />The size of this bicycle makes it suitable for shorter individuals, mainly those of grade school age. The tires are a little wider than those of other bicycles and the handlebars are situated high and wide, for a comfortable grip. A single hand brake, on the right side, helps the rider maintain speed control.<br /><br />This Mongoose bicycle is definitely a good one and it equals or surpasses other bicycles I have owned from Mongoose over the years. The thing I noticed more than anything when I got the box in the mail is how lightweight this bicycle is! I started to wonder if the box I was opening contained something else, because it seemed too light to be a bicycle. And for riding performance, this Mongoose bicycle is top- notch all the way. It steers with ease and really grips the road. It is made for racing, but it can suffice for general use, too, which is what my kid uses it for.<br /><br />Looking for something to improve, I can find exactly one thing: The adjustable seat. My kid needs the seat higher because she is at the upper height limit recommended for this bicycle’s size. It takes effort to get the seat tightened in place at the right height. Over time, no matter how tight I think I have it, the seat slowly sinks. Having the quick, lever- tightening method is convenient, but I would like it more if the seat could be better secured.<br /><br />Bicycling is great for exercise and recreation. The Mongoose Title Elite Pro BMX Race Bike is an excellent bicycle overall; a bicycle that looks slick and offers outstanding performance. Its quality is well above that of other bicycles and I am confident it will easily last for the duration.",0.9974,498,27.666666666666668,0.0,2.29922
"Lawn chairs are useful for many purposes. They come in handy when you attend events and are a practical addition to your backyard. They are not all created equally, though, and one of the better ones I have used is this chair, the Tepui Single Chair.<br /><br />Taken from its transporting bag, this lawn chair is ready to use- you just have to pull the legs apart and stand it up. It has a cup holder for drinks and I like that it is placed below the chair, attached to the leg. With other lawn chairs, the cup holder is right there, on the arm of the chair, and your drink can get in the way of resting your arm. I also like that the covers on each arm are removable. They are held in place with Velcro and if you don’t prefer them, that is perfectly fine, as they are easy to remove.<br /><br />With comfort, this chair is better than most. I don’t get that ‘sinking feeling’ like I often do with other lawn chairs. This one feels more secure and the weight limit rating confirms that it is, indeed, stronger than the average lawn chair. Another cool feature is the mesh back. It allows air to flow through and it does make a difference at keeping you cool and preventing perspiration from forming on your back.<br /><br />This lawn chair is easy enough to fold back up and place into the carrying bag when you’re finished. I should point out that this chair is heavier than others so carrying it for a long distance could be tiring. However, it is also stronger and more durable than others. I am willing to put up with the added weight to have a better lawn chair.<br /><br />I have several different lawn chairs for home and event use. This lawn chair from Tepui is an excellent one overall, delivering on comfort, quality, and strength. It is the best lawn chair I currently own and now that I have used it a few times, I am ready to toss my other, cheaper chairs in the trash and replace them all with this one. It really is that good!",0.996,439,25.823529411764707,0.0,2.2988
"I have a large backyard with a pool and since I live in a warm climate, we tend to spend to good deal of time outside, either using the pool, sitting on the patio, or playing games. We have a good number of outdoor games and when I heard about the Franklin Sports Optima All- Weather Outdoor Tennis Table, I was more than ready to add it to my household’s recreational options.<br /><br />From the large box, this table tennis set does take some time to assemble, so be prepared. Once you get everything set, it is a matter of rolling the table from place to place. My garage is the present location for the table because we can use it here, when we want to play a round of table tennis inside. When we want to take it outside, it is just a matter of rolling it from the garage through the backyard gate and into the back yard.<br /><br />This table tennis set is sturdy and seems like it was built to last. It is heavy, and you will realize this the moment the box arrives in the mail. But the fact that it is on wheels makes you not really notice the weight. It is easy to transport from place to place because of this and when folded, it fits into small spaces for storage. And while the table is made for outdoor use, I think it is best to make it a point to wheel it back inside or into a storage shed after each use. I debated this at first and considered just permanently leaving it outside. But then I decided it was better to make sure it lasts by protecting it from the weather.<br /><br />The aluminum surface on this table tennis set is smooth and ideal for a round of table tennis. The balls bounce well on this surface and the net is easy to install and take down when you’re ready to fold the table and roll it back inside. The table is nine feet long and five feet wide so it will fit in most game rooms. Unlike a billiard table, you don’t need a lot of space on each side so it should fit in many rooms of the typical house.<br /><br />Outdoor games like cornhole and croquet have been part of our backyard recreation for some time and now table tennis is part of the picture, thanks to the franklin Sports Optima All- Weather Outdoor Table Tennis Table. The ease of transporting it and the heavy- duty aluminum construction make this table tennis set a cut above the competition and a great option for people like me who spend a good deal of time outdoors.",0.997,520,34.666666666666664,0.2,2.3591
"One of my kids is really into soccer and she attends camps and plays in soccer leagues whenever she can. She needed a new soccer ball, since her previous ones were worn out and losing air, so I went ahead and got the Wilson NCAA Forte Fybrid II, the official soccer ball of the NCAA championship games.<br /><br />Straight from the box, this soccer ball is a little lighter than expected. In fact, when it arrived in the mail, I thought it had to be something else because the box seemed too light to have a soccer ball inside. But that is what it was and within seconds of opening the box, my kid grabbed it and started to practice.<br /><br />The standout feature with this soccer ball is the design. The colors make it easy to spot and follow with your eyes during play and the textured surface is better for ball control and taking shots. It is superior to other, less expensive soccer balls, some of which have a completely smooth surface and seem more like a volleyball than a soccer ball.<br /><br />My kid reports that this soccer ball is easily better than others she owns so I will take her word for it in that department. However, I am a little concerned about the price. It seems quite costly for a soccer ball and I can see how some people will have reservations about buying for that reason. I can’t really compare this directly with other soccer balls of comparable price because I have never purchased one. But I would bet that, somewhere out there, a manufacturer has a soccer ball that is just as good and priced lower than this one.<br /><br />Soccer is a big deal to my kiddo and she does like the Wilson NCAA Forte Fybrid II soccer ball. It is a good soccer ball overall, but I recommend covering your eyes and not looking at the number on the screen before you purchase. Think too much about the price and you might change your mind.",0.9902,399,33.25,0.1,1.9270600000000002
"I have an assortment of coolers in my house. Ranging in size and functionality, each of the coolers I own serves a purpose and is designed for specific occasions. One type of cooler that I was lacking was a large, heavy duty cooler but that need has now been fulfilled with the addition of the Pelican Elite cooler to my collection.<br /><br />Pelican Elite has several distinct features that set it apart from the typical cooler and some of them are noticeable immediately. The cup holders with drains is one obvious example. Other coolers have cup holders on the lid, but few offer actual drainage like this cooler offers. The interior drain is also unique- it is situated below the cooler’s interior floor, which means the water can be drained completely without having to lift and tilt the cooler.<br /><br />Another feature I like with this Pelican cooler is the handles. Instead of floppy handles or molded handles, these round, pole- style handles let you place your entire hand around them, for secure gripping. Other coolers have only a small space to place your fingers and the cooler can easily slip as a result. This cooler is heavier than most, yes, and it can require two people to carry it when filled with food, beverages, and ice. But you can feel more confident that the cooler will not slip from your hands.<br /><br />When this Pelican cooler is closed and sealed, it stays that way thanks to the latches on the front. Again, this is a definite plus because it means that your lid will stay shut. I have other coolers that feature the traditional style lid that is pushed into place. This method doesn’t work that well. If the cooler is knocked over, the contents will come spilling out. There is no such issue with Pelican, as the latches keep everything safely inside.<br /><br />Pelican Elite keeps food and drink cold for the duration. When I have used this cooler, even several hours after initially filling it with drinks and ice and even after sitting in the hot sun at the beach, there is still very little water inside. And I like that the non- skid feet help keep the cooler securely in place. Even if I put this cooler on a slick surface like, say, the tiled surface on my back porch, it doesn’t slide.<br /><br />Coolers are an essential item and Pelican Elite gets the job done and then some. My smaller, cheaper coolers still have their time and place, but it’s good to have the Pelican Elite when I need a more deluxe cooler for a family outing. It’s the best cooler I have owned and I recommend it for your outdoor entertainment needs.",0.9968,545,27.25,0.2,2.35904
"If there is one thing I want to do more of this year, it’s hiking. Whether it’s a short hike in a nearby park or a longer hike lasting multiple hours in an open wilderness, I want to get outdoors more than in the past. For this reason, I now have an assortment of backpacks and the latest addition to my arsenal is Osprey Rook 50 Backpacking Pack.<br /><br />I needed a larger backpack, capable of holding more items and with more versatility. My other backpacks are generally simplistic in design and not made to handle much more than what you would need for about three or four hours. Osprey Rook 50 Backpacking Pack was the larger addition I was looking for. It has a more rigid design with a solid backing and multiple compartments, including one that can hold a sleeping bag. The mesh side pockets and hip belt pockets provide the space you need for a serious hike. And there are multiple pockets overall, perfect for organizing the different extras necessary for a serious expedition.<br /><br />As for comfort, this one scores good marks. I wasn’t so sure the first time I tried it on for size. I had trouble removing it, but that is because, well, I’m not as flexible as I once was and I didn’t adjust the straps first. That made putting I on easy, but taking it off was a different matter. Once I realized my mistake and adjusted the straps as needed, I didn’t have any trouble at all. I admit, this backpack does feel different from my other backpacks, most of which are not rigid in construction and are more or less collapsible. This Osprey Backpack feels different, but this is to be expected, since it is capable of so much more than others.<br /><br />This backpack is lightweight for its size. I like the ventilated mesh backing- it’s a trampoline style mesh and it helps with airflow, which is good when you live in a hot climate like mine and need any assistance you can get to stay cool. It has a rain cover, too, and multiple ways to adjust the straps for the perfect fit.<br /><br />Hiking is slowing turning into a regular occurrence for me. I have joined a few groups that do regular day hikes across the city, as well as longer hikes on weekend. I liked having an assortment of backpacks and the Osprey Rook 50 Backpacking Pack is a most excellent addition to my collection. I can’t wait to put it to further use this spring when I take longer, more strenuous hikes through central and west Texas.",0.9923,526,27.68421052631579,0.4,2.41769
"If you own a cornhole set, you are well aware of the need to transport the set from your garage to your backyard, basement to car, etc. You could just carry the boards and bean bags the way they are, but a better option is to store the set in a carrying bag. And a good choice for the task is the Backyard Champs 2 x 4 Cornhole Carry Bag.<br /><br />I got hold of this bag at the same time that I obtained a cornhole set, also from Backyard Champs. The idea of a carrying bag made sense, so I added it to my order. The bag is black in color and seals shut with Velcro flaps. It measures two feet in width, four feet in length, and eight inches in thickness. Thus, it has enough space to hold the cornhole set I own, which is from the same company. However, it may not be the correct size for other sets, so make sure you measure first.<br /><br />The carrying handles on this bag are a little thinner than expected. They are also looped more widely than I feel they should be. A little less width, more like a briefcase handle, would seem better. The cornhole set I have isn’t too heavy so I think the handles will hold up, but there is still a little more looseness than I prefer. I hope I am proven wrong and that the manufacturer knew what they were doing when they designed the bag, but it just seems a little too loose for me. I suppose they made the loop larger so that you can place the handle over your shoulder but I prefer to carry it more like a suitcase.<br /><br />Cornhole sets are often bulky and they need to be protected when transporting from one place to another. A carrying bag makes sense and the Backyard Champs 2 x 4 Cornhole Carry Bag is a good choice for the task. A little more snug fit and a separate compartment for the bean bags would make this bag better, but it is a good enough bag for the job.",0.9944,413,27.53333333333333,0.2,1.95832
"One game that seems to be quite popular nowadays is cornhole. It’s a simple game and I often find it at local taverns, breweries, etc that have a large outdoor space. It’s also the type of game I find at friend’s houses and so it made sense to get a set of my own, the Backyard Champs Wood Cornhole Set.<br /><br />With the American flag design on the two cornhole boards, this set has a patriotic look, which adds to its appeal, since it is certainly better than the plain cornhole boards so common in backyards across America. The boards come complete with bean bags, too, but there is no net to catch the bags, like with some cornhole sets. With this set, the bags will go through the opening and hit the surface beneath, so you need to make sure to place the boards on a reasonably clean surface.<br /><br />The wood construction of this cornhole set is nice and I like how they attach together with Velcro. There are Velcro strips on the backs of the boards and this makes it easier to carry the boards around. The Velcro keeps them together, so when it comes time to pack up and leave, you almost feel like you’re carrying a single item. They don’t weigh too much either, so it takes little effort to move the boards from place to place.<br /><br />Backyard Champs Wood Cornhole Set is easy to set up and play straight from the box. The sturdy boards are made to last and the 8 included bean bags weigh 12 oz each, which is heavy enough to make them good for this type of game; less likely to slide past the opening and slide off of the board. The legs fold flat against the backside, so attaching the boards together with the Velcro is easy.<br /><br />Cornhole is a popular backyard game and since I play it frequently when I go places, I decided it was time to get a game of my own. Backyard Champs Wood Cornhole Set is a very good cornhole game set with a nice design and good durability. It’s a game I recommend for anyone who likes simple, outdoor entertainment for kids and guests.",0.9973,444,37.0,0.5,2.4491899999999998
"Family games are a cool way to spend time together and one of my favorite games from my younger days is darts. Keeping track of scores when you play darts is a hassle, but the problem is easily resolved with an electronic dart board like the Viper Solar Blast Electronic Soft Tip Dartboard.<br /><br />Unpackaging this dart board, the first thing I discovered is that it’s a little larger than expected. This could impact where you place the board, since it will take up a little more wall space than you might think. I have a large wall area in my family room, so it wasn’t a huge issue for me, but just bear in mind that the board is wider than many others.<br /><br />This dartboard features a large number of games, many of which I have ever heard of before. Cricket and 301 are the games I like playing the best but it’s nice to know that other, new games exist, in case we are so inclined to try them out. It’s also cool that this electronic dart board can accommodate up to 16 players- 4 teams of up to 4 each- because that means more people can join the fun, even though I have never had more than three players at any one time.<br /><br />The dart board itself seems well- made and the darts stick with relative ease. The scoring is accurate too. It would be better if the score display was a little larger and easier to see, but I suppose it is good the way it is. I like that the darts are soft- tipped because it means less chance for damage to the walls and other household items. The darts, however, seem cheaply made and I don’t know how long they will last. I see from reading other reviews that I’m not the only one who has noticed this. Some reviewers report that their darts broke after only a few games, so I fully expect to have to replace my darts in a short time.<br /><br />Playing darts is a fun way to pass the time and it’s good as a test of one’s coordination skills. Viper Solar Blast Dartboard is a good dartboard overall. The darts are my only issue with this game; other than that one concern, it is a dartboard I recommend.",0.9967,465,33.214285714285715,0.0,1.89901
"If you own a home, there are certain, basic tools you need for day to day functioning and care on the outside of your house. Most households already have things like lawn mowers, shears, shovel, etc., but other tools that you will need eventually are an ax and a saw. The Zippo Axesaw takes care of both in a single tool.<br /><br />Zippo Axesaw is an ax, saw, and mallet all in one and it’s ready to assist when you need to chop, cut, and hammer. The ax- or more accurately, the hatchet- is good for chopping small branches and it seems like it was made to last. The saw, which is the tool I use most, is good for pruning trees. It cuts through them with relative ease. The handling of the saw is not as comfortable as other hand/pruning saws I have used, but it’s still good enough for my needs.<br /><br />With the mallet, the uses are a little bit limited. The head of the mallet is made from plastic, so you have to be careful what you use it for. It cannot take the place of a metal hammer, so don’t use it for anything except light pounding of things like, say, the stakes for a tent. If you remember its limits, you should be okay.<br /><br />Having all three of these tools in one is a good idea and I generally like this tool for that reason. However, I will be the first to admit that my other stand- alone hand saws, axes, and mallets are better if I compared them each, one to one, with the corresponding tool in the Zippo Axesaw. With this tool, you sacrifice some of the performance for convenience. But again, as long as you don’t get carried away and try to use the hatchet to chop down a large tree, you should be fine.<br /><br />Every household needs the basic tools for outdoor care and the Zippo Axesaw is a good choice for many tasks. It’s nice to have all three tools in one device and they each perform at a satisfactory level. I’m not thrilled with the comfort of the handle when using the saw, but this tool is still good for my limited outdoor needs.",0.9956,463,30.866666666666667,0.0,1.4986800000000002
"Foosball was a huge hit in college. Who doesn’t remember knocking back a few cold ones while trying to show your masterful skills at the foosball table? Now, Franklin Sports has a scaled down version of the popular game with its 20 inch Pro Kick Foosball set.<br /><br />Due to the smaller size of this set, I figured it would be good for my kids and when I received this package in the mail, I opened the box expecting the game to be fully assembled and ready to play. It wasn’t. You have to assemble by hand and from what I discovered, the assembly is not that easy. Worse, my set was missing a few important pieces so we were unable to complete the set up until I made a quick trip to a home supply store.<br /><br />Once assembled, we started to use the game, but we soon noticed that the handles do not move back and forth very smoothly and the screws do not hold very well. The construction of the game is not the best and I really think it would be better of the manufacturer changed things up by using better quality construction. Having it packaged ready to play would be nice, but I could tolerate a little bit of home assembly if the end product was sturdier and better designed.<br /><br />Franklin Pro Kick Foosball set is too small for adults. It’s really made for children and while I thought my kiddos would find it mildly entertaining, they grew frustrated with it very quickly. It’s an okay idea, but the overall quality and missing pieces convince me to lower my rating and not recommend.",0.9324,328,32.8,0.0,1.07972
"We like to play games in my household and since my kids love electronics, it makes sense that electronic games would be a popular option with them. So, given my kids love of lights and action, we decided to give Franklin Sports Electronic Basketball Bounce Junior a try.<br /><br />The game concept is simple enough. You bounce one of the two small basketballs on the trampoline  aim for the hops, and try to achieve the highest possible score. You have 30 seconds to hit as many hoops as you can, with the bottom nets worth 10 points, the middle worth 30, and the top one worth 50. Once the 30 seconds are up, the electronic scoring display will show you the result. You can then challenge someone else and make real game out of it. It’s simple fun and kids like it, so it does earn some points in this area.<br /><br />Other qualities of this toy, however, convince me to reduce my rating. One is the construction. They need to come up with a better way to explain how the different pieces fit together. I couldn’t get the net to fit at first and it was because I didn’t assemble some of the pieces correctly. A little better, more thorough effort on the part of the manufacturer would have made it much simpler and less frustrating.<br /><br />I have other issues with this toy besides the assembly. One is the ball return. The netting and back piece are loose and are supposed to provide enough space for the balls to drop back to the front so that you can bounce them in quick succession for the best possible score. But the problem is, the balls get stuck, costing valuable time because you have to reach behind and move the backing around to get the ball to drop. This most commonly happens if you hit the 30 or 50 point hoops. The 10 point hoops seem to have sufficient clearance. Another issue I have is with the extension of the net. It needs to be larger so that it can capture the misses and keep the balls contained. But it doesn’t extend very far and that means the basketballs will likely go flying in different directions, again forcing someone to chase them down as the bounce away from the game. Then, there is the trampoline. I don’t know why, but when we bounce, the balls tend to go toward the left. Even a concerted effort to hit the baskets on the right side often doesn’t work- the balls keep wanting to go to the left.<br /><br />I like the overall idea of this basketball game and the price is reasonable. But the manufacturer needs to make a few simple changes to make the game better. At the very least, the backing needs to be larger so that the balls return with ease. With this and other issues, I cannot rate this game very highly or recommend it overall.",0.9843,584,23.36,0.0,1.09529
"Physical strength training is a good idea. Some people join health clubs and use their machines to provide the training they need, but one good and economical alternative is to have a weight bench of your own. And this is where the Adidas Essential Combo Training Bench with Weight Set can help. It has everything you need to begin meeting your fitness goals.<br /><br />Adidas training bench is a useful, although basic weight bench. You get the bench plus a leg lift and a set of weights that total 100 pounds. It’s nice to get an all in one set because you don’t need to shop separately for a set of weights when you purchase the bench. You can use this for bench press and leg lifts, which makes it just right for beginners.<br /><br />The weights included with this set are vinyl in construction, so nothing fancy but they are sufficient for the task. I like the easy to remove and tighten clamps on the barbell- you don’t need any special tools to put them on or take them off. This is better than the weight sets of the past, many of which required a wrench to fasten and loosen the clamps. The bench is good too- nothing amazing, but rather very utilitarian and capable of helping you build strength.<br /><br />Weight sets are a good addition to any home. They will easily pay for themselves over time, when compared to joining your local gym. This set is basic, but it accomplishes what it promises and even though it won’t meet the needs of more advanced weight trainers, it has enough going for it to meet the needs of beginners and enough quality of design and construction to recommend.",0.9959,340,28.33333333333333,0.3,1.9887700000000001
"Kids like to have fun and one good way to get them out of the house and encourage exercise is with a scooter. And one scooter my youngest child seems to like is the Madd Gear USA Alloy Kick Scooter.<br /><br />This is a small scooter intended for smaller children, mainly elementary school age. My nine year old fits the age and weight limits just fine and her height is just right, as she can grasp the handle and scoot along with no problem. Older elementary school age children and larger kids in general may be too big for this, so make sure you check before you buy.<br /><br />A smooth ride is important with any scooter and this one earns good marks in this area. My kid has no problem taking this for a spin down the sidewalk, pushing herself along, and stopping when necessary. She has yet to learn how to ride a bicycle without training wheels, so this scooter is, I hope, a good prelude. It does help build a child’s confidence so that bicycle riding will come easier.<br /><br />Madd Gear Kick Scooter folds up easily for storage and can fit in small spaces. The price is good, too. So, when all factors are considered, I am hard pressed to find any faults with this scooter and it earns my highest recommendation.",0.9896,269,29.88888888888889,0.4,2.41688
"My girls love to ride their bicycles, but I have noticed that, gradually over the course of about a week, their tires lose a little bit of air. The leak isn’t enough to warrant replacement tires/tubes, but the tires are in constant need of air and this compact pump from Kitbest is a good choice for the job.<br /><br />We have a couple different tire pumps in our household, but most are larger and bulkier- much more than is needed to pump air into a child’s bicycle tire. Kitbest hand pump is noteworthy for its small size and it even attaches itself directly to a bicycle, so it’s always there when you need it. I would say the lightweight design and ability to attach to a bicycle are easily the device’s strongest points.<br /><br />This pump is generally easy enough to use and it takes only a few back and forth pumps to get tires inflated and ready to go. One issue that I have with this pump, however, is the problem of getting it to firmly attach itself to the valves. I like that the pump has two different valve openings- one for shrader and one for presta valves- because this makes it more practical for general inflating needs. But getting the end of the pump to stay in place does take effort. If you don’t get it right, you will know because you will pump and pump and notice that little or no air is getting into the tires. You will have to then unlock, reattach, and try again.<br /><br />Tire pumps are a necessity for those with bicycles and this mini pump from Kitbest is a good choice for most pumping needs. Like I said, the compact size and ability to mount it directly on a bicycle are its two strongest points. The problem with getting it to remain attached to a valve is not one to overlook, but it will work with effort and the pump has enough overall good qualities to recommend.<br /><br />Note: I received this product complimentary in exchange for an unbiased review, but I was not compensated in any way.",0.9897,422,38.36363636363637,0.0,1.89691
"Everyone’s putting game could use a little work. And the best way to improve is through daily practice- practice made possible with the Pinemeadow Golf Site 1 Putter.<br /><br />I don’t do much golfing but I do take the occasional swing and putting is the area where I need the most work. This putter is a good one for practicing my technique. It grips well and feels comfortable in the hands. It could cause some issues for taller people but most everyone else will find that this putter works well.<br /><br />Doing practice shots with this putter is good for improving skill and that is where I think this Pinemeadow golf club has the greatest value. I’m not so sure I would take it directly to the golf course and use it if I was golfing in a serious way. But for practice, it seems perfect. It’s good for miniature golf, too, which of course is comprised of continuous putts.<br /><br />Putters can get expensive, but this Pinemeadow golf club sells for a fair price. The more intense golfer might find this putter a little too basic and insist on a better putting tool. There are fancier putters out there, but they command a much higher price. This Pinemeadow putter seems right for the task.<br /><br />I’m not the golfing maniac that some people are, but I do play the occasional golf and putting is the one area that always seems to need work. The Pinemeadow Golf Site 1 Putter is good for practice purposes and it can make a difference as you strive to perfect your swing and technique.",0.9962,326,27.166666666666668,0.0,1.89886
"If water sports are to your liking, then the Sevylor Mesa Paddle Board is something to consider. It can be used on any body of water- including the ocean- for a hours of fitness and recreation.<br /><br />A paddle board isn’t something many people have ever heard of, but it’s like a cross between a surfboard and a paddle boat. You stand on the board, like you would with a surf board, and then paddle like you would with a boat. Paddle boards are designed to accommodate the needs of a person who is standing and rowing, making it unique among non- powered water craft.<br /><br />As for the Sevylor Paddle Board, it is made with beginners/intermediate users in mind. The board does not come in a long box- it is folded up in a square box and has to be inflated to use. I was surprised at how heavy the box is, but it’s because there is a lot of material inside and the board itself is very thick. Once inflated, the board measures about 2.5 feet in width, which is wide enough to allow for comfortable standing and maneuvering. The fact that the board is inflatable makes it much easier to transport and carry around. Just deflate, fold it up, and you can take it or store it almost anyplace.<br /><br />A flat board would not seem like something that would be stable in open water, but the Sevylor Paddle Board is quite remarkable in this regard. On a lake with few or moderate waves, it’s as steady as a canoe or paddle boat- perhaps even more so. The surface where you stand is slip- proof and with the three fins, one is removable, for better handling when you need it. I cannot comment on how this board would be in the ocean because I haven’t used it there, but it seems like it is well suited for that purpose.<br /><br />Water sports are great for fitness and recreation and paddle boards are a nice way to experience the water without much worry. Sevylor Mesa Paddle Board is a very good board for the needs of most people, excluding perhaps the more advanced paddlers among us. It has the features you need for an enjoyable day of water recreation.",0.9967,451,32.214285714285715,0.2,1.9590100000000001
"I’m not an outdoorsman, but I admit that a good, sharp nice does come in handy for different household needs. The Coast Double Lock Folding Knife is a very good knife for these purposes. It works well for cutting rope, carpet, and other things that are not easy to slice with ordinary knives or scissors.<br /><br />I did have some problems when I first received this knife; namely, learning how to open it and then close it back into its protective handle. With other knives, you just grab the blade and pull. That technique will not work here. I started to turn to the internet for an answer when I finally figured it out. You have to move a small, rolling piece and move another metal piece for opening/closing. It’s a little awkward, but I like that it takes effort because it is an added measure of safety. I don’t need to worry so much if one of my kids would happen to find the knife in its locked position because there is almost no way they would figure out how to open it.<br /><br />As I said, I don’t venture into the outdoors very often, so I have no need for a genuine hunting knife. But this knife is useful for much more than that. Anytime I have a difficult cutting job, like say, with heavy cardboard or rope, this knife comes to my rescue. Scissors will work for these purposes, but they take too much effort and leave you with sore fingers. This Coast knife slices through these materials with ease.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this knife and recommend it for household use. I cannot comment on its effectiveness in the field, but I would bet it would work well for outdoorsman, too. It’s sharp and handy and the double locking mechanism helps make it safer to use.",0.9825,377,25.133333333333333,0.0,1.8947500000000002
"Umbrellas are important when you live in a rainy climate like I do. The rain can start falling at any time and it can get rather intense. Even a short walk can leave you completely drenched, so it is important to have protection like that provided by the Urbanite folding umbrella readily available.<br /><br />This umbrella is a nice size and one of its best features is that it opens and expands on its own, with the push of a button. A feature like this is, of course, nothing original, but I am still thankful that this umbrella offers this feature because it makes it that much more convenient. I usually keep the umbrella in my back seat, then reach for it when the rain starts to pour. A simple push of a button and the umbrella expands, sliding vertically, then opening up quickly, ready to protect you from the rain.<br /><br />Another feature I like with this umbrella is that it does a better job handling the wind. Some umbrellas are so solid in design that the force of the wind can make you feel like you are being pushed over. There is no such problem here. The umbrella is designed in such a way that the wind is able to blow through it, to an extent, and this makes it much easier to handle. You are still protected from the water, and that is what matters most. But it is nice not to have that feeling that your umbrella is more a wind shield than a protective device from the rain. Those types of umbrellas often get damaged quickly due to the force of the wind against the fabric, but you don't get that feeling here.<br /><br />I am a little concerned about the amount of plastic used in the construction of this umbrella, but when you consider the price, it really doesn't matter that much. There are more durable umbrellas out there, but this one is still a very good value and one I definitely recommend.",0.9947,391,30.07692307692308,0.1,1.9284100000000002
"Britax has been making things for children for a very long time and it enjoys a strong reputation as a company that produces quality products. The high regard myself and others have for Britax was enough to convince me to obtain this bicycle seat and I have not regretted my decision.<br /><br />I have two small girls, one of whom is still small enough to use a seat such as this. The weight limit is 40 pounds, so it is only going to work for children roughly four years of age or younger. My little one is still light enough and when she was first introduced, she took to this seat right away. She likes the adventurous feeling of riding on the back of the bicycle and I feel good knowing that she is safe and secure.<br /><br />Looking at the specifics of this Britax bicycle seat, the seat is very sturdy in construction and it takes about 20 minutes from the box to the point where it is ready to use. It fits most all bicycles with 26 to 28 inch wheels, which would be just about every adult bicycle manufactured. It has a built in suspension for your child's comfort and this can be a great asset if the roads or sidewalks in your area are full of potholes and bumps. The headrest has nine position settings, the footrest has fifteen positions, and the harness locks securely in place, for maximum safety.  The padding can be removed and is machine washable, for added convenience, and the product carries a limited two- year warranty.<br /><br />Going for a spin with a child in a small seat behind you is quite an adventure and it does take getting used to. The added weight means you have to be more careful when you stop, when you start, and how you maneuver because you always have to be mindful of the child behind you and their safety. I admit that I was a little anxious when I used this at first, but my anxiety quickly faded when I started to ride. Once you get the hang of it, like anything, it gets easier. And it is very fun for the small child in the back who gets to enjoy the sites and the excitement of riding out in the open.<br /><br />All things considered, I am hard pressed to find anything wrong with this bicycle seat and I recommend it for those with small children who like the adventure and fitness they receive from riding a bicycle. I would like to ride more, and perhaps this bicycle seat will encourage me to get more active. The seat is solid in construction, fairly easy to install, and made with safety in mind. It has all the earmarks of another quality Britax product and it earns a easy recommendation.",0.9971,539,33.6875,0.3,2.3891299999999998
"Proform Power 1080 Treadmill is a large treadmill with enough extra features to make workouts more enjoyable and more likely to take place. This treadmill is much more than a simple belt with readout of time and distance. Proform made this treadmill more sophisticated with multiple options, different workout plans, and added accessories to keep your workout running smoothly.<br /><br />The Proform Power 1080 Treadmill is a high- tech machine and it has several different walking/jogging routines to suit your exercise needs. You can select what you want, tailored to your own needs, and perform your workout. The Proform Power 1080 Treadmill includes four main workout option categories: calorie burning workout, all- terrain, set a goal, and iFit, which uses wifi. No matter which option you use, the treadmill provides you with a full report showing your distance, average speed, elapsed time, vertical feet climbed, heart rate, and more.<br /><br />Those who have not worked out much should probably begin with the set a goal workout or the calorie burning workout. The set a goal option lets you define a goal based on distance, time, or calorie- burning. The calorie- burning workout goes straight for the gut, letting you select a number of calories you would like to burn using pre- set options which can be adjusted to your own desired levels. These two are self- defined options make things easy through the use of defaulted settings, but you can still change them to suit your desires. For example, I may select a workout goal of 1 mile. The treadmill will default to a basic workout with inclines, varying speeds, etc. If I like, I can make a slight adjustment and, for example, change the time from 18 minutes to 12 and remove any percentage inclines. This is nice because the added flexibility lets you create a workout that is just right for you.  Even after a workout has started, you can still make adjustments to the speed and percentage incline by pushing a button.<br /><br />For the more advanced and/or more adventurous, this Proform treadmill has you covered. The iFit Live accesses more challenging workouts that are completely varied and the treadmill will change speed and incline on its own with greater frequency than you get with the calorie burning workout or other options. The idea is to make the experience similar to what you would go through if you were jogging through a place with varied hills, speeds, etc. It even accesses Google Maps to create a workout based on a specific location. The iFit feature requires accessing your wifi so it does take a little preparation, but the live action makes this one of the more enjoyable features of this treadmill. Once you setup an account, it remembers you and what you did the last time. It even keeps track of different family members and then reminds each of what they did before and what phase of the workout is next phase so that each person can pick up where they left off.<br /><br />The Proform Power 1080 Treadmill is certainly a very cool, very modern treadmill, but is there anything that Proform overlooked or that needs improvement? Well, yes, there are a few things. One problem is the fan. The treadmill has a built- in fan and while this is certainly a good idea, the fan is far too weak to make it useful and there is no way to aim the air directly at your face. You need a second and better source of air than this to keep you cooled down and focused. Another surprising oversight is the lack of a holder for a water bottle. There are two square- shaped places where a beverage may be placed, but the shape isn't round and thus it will not hold a round bottle very securely. A third possible problem area for some is the time it takes for the screen to boot up. I find that the touch screen is responsive and works well, but it takes up to a minute after the power is turned on before the screen responds.<br /><br />Exercising is certainly important and the Proform Power 1080 Treadmill is a very good, very sturdy treadmill with many features that work to encourage exercise. It isn't perfect, but with many cool and useful features like iFit, customized controls, sound systems for your iPod or MP3 player, and a solid warranty, this treadmill has much going for it and makes a very good choice for your next piece of exercise equipment.",0.9985,868,29.93103448275862,0.4,2.01955
"Sportcraft Anywhere Table Tennis set is a handy way to enjoy some instant, spur of the moment fun. With this set, you don't need to worry about pulling out the large tennis table stored in the garage and finding a place to set it up. With Sportcraft Anywhere Table Tennis set, most any table can be quickly turned into a tennis table for immediate fun and entertainment.<br /><br />This set consists of everything you need to play table tennis, except for the table, of course. All you do it anchor the two posts to a table, remove the balls and paddles, and the game is on. The posts can be attached to the edges of any table up to six feet, three inches in width and no more than 1.75 inches in thickness. The net itself is spring- mounted and the bases of the posts are rubberized to protect the table surface beneath.<br /><br />We have multiple tables in my house and the one we tend to use for this game is our game room table. It is a little small (a larger, closer to regulation size table would be better), but the posts fit and it works just fine for my family, which includes two children who are still too young to play on a lager table anyway. One of my other tables isn't usable for this purpose because its edges are too thick, but I have two tables in the house that work just fine and considering that a table can be up to 1.75 inches in thickness and fit the posts, most households will likely have a table that works for this purpose.<br /><br />This set comes complete with a pair of paddles and three balls. You need to keep track of the balls- they are small and will get lost if you're not careful. The paddles are not the greatest quality, but one has to remember that this set is intended more for the casual table tennis player. It isn't meant for the serious competitor and will likely not suffice for that purpose.<br /><br />A good, physical, indoor game makes a nice change of pace from the usual board game and for this reason, I am glad I received the Sportcraft Anywhere Table Tennis set. It quickly turns most any table into a tennis table, saving families the space problems and expense of buying a regular table tennis set.",0.9688,467,38.91666666666666,0.5,2.0406400000000002
"The Huffy Disney Princess Scooter is a steel- framed scooter designed to help youngsters get used to the scooter concept before they move on to the two- wheeled variety. This warm- up scooter features the immensely popular Disney Princess theme, making it an instant hit with young girls everywhere.<br /><br />The Huffy Disney Princess Scooter is sold disassembled with the pieces in a small box. Putting everything together isn't too difficult, but the process would be much easier if the instructions were clearer. The instructions don't walk you through the assembly process step by step. Instead, they show you a diagram with the different parts pulled apart from the scooter so that consumers can see what goes on first, second, third, etc. This eventually works, but it would have been much better if the instructions were step- by- step and if the images were larger.<br /><br />As for the product itself, it offers a large footplate with a no- slip design and it has a very cute appearance that young girls will love. I like the skateboard- size footplate and the sturdy, steel frame. The third wheel is nice because it keeps the scooter steady while kids learn how to ride and maneuver. Parents don't need to worry so much that their little one will fall off- the third wheel helps keep the scooter upright while in use.<br /><br />The Huffy Disney Princess Scooter has adjustable handlebars, but adjusting the height takes a little bit of work and it is possible that some of the other parts will fall off as you make your adjustment. This is another area where the scooter deserves a small amount of criticism. One example is the flimsy plastic piece that acts as a guard and is placed over the handlebar- adjustment bolt. It doesn't lock into place very well and is easily moved around. Then, there is the adjustment bolt itself. It is somewhat annoying to work with because there is almost no clearance space. The nut and washer that go on the end leave almost no space to thread and tighten the bolt.<br /><br />The Huffy Disney Princess Scooter is a cute, fun scooter that offers safety while preparing youngsters for the day when they decide to graduate to the two- wheeled variety. It isn't perfect, for the reasons stated above, but it does have many good qualities and my little girl loves it. These positive qualities are reason enough to consider making this purchase for your preschool age child.",0.9951,481,28.294117647058822,1.5,2.3485300000000002
"Coleman's Quickpump is a handy device for those who own inflatable rafts, large flotation devices, air mattresses and other object s that require too much air to inflate manually. This air pump quickly fills up any inflatable object, saving you the huffing and puffing necessary to inflate the old fashioned way.<br /><br />One of the many nice things about this pump is the fact that it is electric. Many air pumps- like those that are often included when purchasing an air mattress- are battery powered. This means that the batteries could fail at some point when you need the pump most, delaying your attempt to inflate your favorite flotation device. With Quickpump, you get electric, rechargeable energy. You just plug the pump into a socket, using the detachable cord, let it charge, and then take it directly to the item that needs to be inflated.<br /><br />Coleman includes some different attachments for use on different valves (like a wider attachment for Boston valves) and it also includes a hose at the end for added convenience. With this hose, you can stand back, hold the base of the unit a short distance away, and direct the flow of air into the valve. This makes the use of the pump more comfortable.<br /><br />This pump does have a few limitations. It will not work on objects that require a needle tip (like a basketball) or similar inflationary requirement. There are no adaptors for this, so you will not be able to use Quickpump. Also, keep in mind that this pump is a little on the noisy side. For something so compact (it weighs only about 4 pounds) it really makes a lot of noise.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good pump to own for those who have large inflatable items that cannot be inflated by hand. The pump recharges quickly and efficiently, providing a constant, steady flow of air without the worry of having batteries fail. It makes a nice choice of gift for campers and others who need a solid, reliable air pump that they can count on.",0.9738,415,29.642857142857142,3.1,2.82214

"Decent bench but does come with some issues.<br /><br />Pros-  Moves around (on hard floors) easily so you can move it to new workout position in the room.  Good black paint job and looks nice, Great weight storage, adjustable slots, curl bar and leg lift apparatus is good. Relatively solid look and feel (minus the bench)<br /><br />Cons -  The bench is wobbly which is incredibly distracting and very frustrating.  I have shoved wood shims into the bench shaft and that has helped but I cannot adjust the seat forward or backward with the wood shims in place.  Seat attaching to adjustable shaft is also wobbly so both wobbles combined is frustrating and distracting.  The bench is not detachable so when doing flat fly's you sometimes hit the barbell rack.  Finally the seat does not adjust  and pivot up far enough to do some of the exercises.  It only adjust flat, medium and a little above medium.",0.8059,189,23.625,0.2,1.5017700000000003

"I purchased my first two at Walmart a few years ago- they were the most expensive ones Walmart sold.  I needed one that absolutely would not spill,(my cat likes to knock things over)  held plenty of water and kept it cold and came in cool colors.  Well after a year or two I lost my first one (a beautiful shade of teal so I bought one in the navy which is also really lovely.  I'm buying two more to keep on hand so I can rotate cleaning the lids in the dishwater.  Unlike other people I haven't had any problems keeping the mouthpiece clean.  The paint on the cup - after several dishwasher washings - did start to come off.  So no more dishwasher for it.  I have dropped these bottles countless times, I would have had to replace so many keyboards and other electronics by now if it wasn't for the seal on this cup.  Makes a horrible metal sound when you (or the cat) knock it over but you'll pick it up and notice that not a drop of water has spilled.  It even seems to tighten close in either direction but underfill just a bit to fit the lid on top.  Overtime it will be a bit leaky when you first fill it but that will go away quickly.  I guess the other complaint about these is that they do not handle hot drinks.  If you've ever taken a sip of McDonald's coffee right after it's poured - and burnt yourself, you probably would want to buy a cup that lets some of that steam out and lets the coffee slowly cool.  This is NOT that cup.  I will fill it with ice and water about 10 pm, and unless I drink it all there will still be ice and water in the cup in the morning - and this is with no special insulation - just the metal cup.  I live alone so I'm the only one using these cups.  I also have terrible dry mouth problems (I'm on oxygen) - so I take one with me to every doctor's appointment and if you open the little handle you can hold the entire full cup with one finger or pinky.  So I can carry an o2 cannister, purse and cup of water at the same time.",-0.138,431,23.944444444444443,0.0,1.9586

It has a HANDLE that is small enough to carry with your pinky finger - LOVE this when my hands are full.  Not sure why this isn't the #1 bottle on the market!

"I really just wanted a couple of camp chairs similar to the very old ones that are finally worn out after at least 10 years of frequent use. The problem with this chair is the ""cooler"" which doesn't have a way to drain. This completely negates the quick fold up and pack away option I want in a camp chair. I found having a netted cup holder on each arm to be a much more useful feature. If you've used the cooler and it is wet you really don't want to leave it closed or the chair folded for long.

I am buying a second for my daughter next summer.  It says 30-50lbs and I think that is pretty accurate.  My son is a skinny 3 1/2 year old and fits perfect.  My petitie 1 1/2 year old is still too small for this but I will be getting one for her next summer.,0.9847,137,17.125,0.1,2.3254099999999998

I use these for lap swimming at the pool.  I have a small head and in the past had to buy kids goggles.  These fit my small head great.  Didn't leak and hold up to my semi daily lap swims.

"I bought this watchband because I'm a professional handyman and my watch takes a beating. Ergo...the band also takes a beating. It's constantly getting &#34;caught&#34; on something or other, getting covered with paint spatters, or dirt & grease.  Metal bands get bent, don't &#34;give&#34; when they snag something (thereby scratching or cutting my wrist) and are a pain to clean.<br />It took a few min to figure how to wear it (because it just wraps around wrist)  but it will fit as tightly or loosely as you wish. And I just scrub it under hot water to get it clean again.  I'm going to buy another, just in case I can't find it again.",0.6428,155,25.83333333333333,0.0,1.79284

Being stuck at home hasn't helped, but I remembered loving step classes in the past, so I went and ordered the Reebok step (blast from the past).<br /><br />This is a great stepper. It's nice and big for all the moves and travelling, it's non-slip, and it feels sturdy (it's pretty heavy, so you won't want to drag it around). The main issue for me is that the lowest setting is 6 inches. On other steps, it's 4 inches. Those 2 inches REALLY make a difference as you are getting back in the game.

This is a great bottle for lunches for my Kindergartener. She can easily open it and it has yet to leak. It fits in her lunch box which I would say is a standard size (not overly big or small). I got the 14 oz size. She takes it in the morning with ice and water and when she brings it home it still has ice (about 8 hours). I have even left the ice in it overnight and the next day it was barely melted. I would say it would keep ice for a good 2 to 3 days if closed properly and filled with cold liquids.

The gels on the pad are quite sticky so I have to be careful when I ""peel"" them off after the workout.

Very easy to put on. I bought the two blue ones to attached to the front wheel. I have a pretty visible flashing red light at the back. I ride mostly on city streets so it's important to be visible when the sun is going down. Putting the two blue ones on the front wheel helps me to turn them on without dismounting when I have stopped. I turn them on when it's getting dark. The two lamps also creates a bluish light just underneath the bike. That in combination with the forward flashlight mounted on the handlebar gives me enough visibility as I move forward and also for cars that are passing me and making any right turns or veering  into my lane.<br /><br />Very happy with this product.,0.9356,147,18.375,0.7,2.49068

"Simple. Easy to install. Well made. Good looking. And IT WORKS! I am not a fancy bike rider. I have a Costco bike that is steel and not those fancy carbon fiber things (or even aluminum). I ride everyday just to lose weight and get my cardio while the gyms are closed. Didn't really pay attention to the way I was peddling until I started getting really bad pain in one of my knees. So I went to a chiro and he is an avid rider too and told me to try putting toe clips on my peddles. So I listened to him and voila! My pain is mostly gone now! Just took a week of riding with the these!<br /><br />The tow clips are pretty nice and shiny (might rust since it's chrome, I'll spray paint some matte paint on it when that happens). It was very easy to put on with the 4 screws and nuts and washers that came with it. I had to adjust the one on the left a little bit more to that right of the peddle after my first ride. I wear mostly running\jogging sneakers on my ride and they fit in perfectly inside the clips. I wear a size 8 (US) and the medium size  clips are perfect for centering the ball of my feet to the middle of the peddle. I had noticed I used to slide my feet up when I was riding against the wind or uphill before. That's probably what caused the knee\muscle pain  I had.<br /><br />I am very happy with these and I might live it in my will for my next of kin to inherit! :-)",0.9493,328,16.4,0.2,2.34479

I do take the bike out everyday and some of the trail can get bumpy, but this kind of mounts are supposed to be able to handle that!<br /><br />Not going to buy this again.

"I usually ride my road bike on the road. With the recent fires in CA, the air has been very bad. So I got this for days I can't go out for my ride (weather is the issue). The setup is very easy.

Right now, I am using my yoga mat under it but didn't help much.<br /><br />The instruction coolly says that 50% of the noise comes from the wheel :-). I doubt that my bike makes the deep ""whooom-wrr-wrr"" noise on it's own, even 50%.<br /><br />But I can live with it. Only going to use it when I can't ride outside and no one lives below me.

I have a secondary saddle bag hanging from the bar where I keep all the other biggish items including the battery pack for my phone.

"Great light! It's really bright and the various mode are very useful. I live in CA so I can only use the red color. I can tell it really gets peoples attention because people making right turns over the bike lane actually waits behind me on a red light. :-)<br /><br />Battery lasts for about 4-5 hours (my ride is 1.30 hours/day). Charging is simple. I use a regular charger base (not the fast charging) because I am not sure if this unit can deal with high charge rate. I had bad luck with other things like usb headphones that just couldn't handle fast charging. The regular charging speed is about a few hours. So I usually charge it after a few rides for 2-3 hours.<br /><br />Mounting is easy. I ride on city streets, so I cannot tell if the thing with stay on after a very bumpy ride.

Actual inflation/deflation of kayak with back bone takes me about 10 minutes max. My first time was probably 30-40 minutes just trying to internalize the steps. So if you’re new to it do a practice run to get a feel for it.<br /><br />The non-drop stitch floor is probably my biggest concern as far as air leaks go. It’s not nearly as protected as the other inflatable sections and coarse carry on items are in direct contact if sat inside the kayak.<br /><br />Leg room is a bit lacking. I am 5’8” however my feet are right up against the inner air chamber. Will probably have to get a longer version. For reference I would say it’s about 44” from the rear of the combing to the inner air chamber at the bow.<br /><br />I do feel secure in the kayak overall and plan to upsize with a drop stitch floor.,-0.2746,189,27.0,0.1,1.9476200000000001

We use fold up chairs all of the time for kid’s sporting events.  I purchased 4 new chairs in the Spring and by the end of that sports season 2 wouldn’t collapse amd were stuck In the up position.  I was so disappointed because they were expensive branding and I thought that they would last. To tell you the truth I purchased this chair because I read good reviews and I really liked the wing type of arms.  I only purchased 1 as a trial instead of purchasing 2 to replace the broken chairs. I am so happy with the chair. It folds up and down so well and has a very sturdy bag. The area are very wide and it is so comfortable.  It has 2 vented cup holders and also 2 pockets that I am not even sure what I will put in there on the side arms. This is a very cool chair.  We decided that it will be a great camping chair that could even be used to nap in.  I highly recommend this-we are purchasing more. M,0.9455,198,15.23076923076923,0.8,2.52365

I also have 3 Yeti hard coolers as well as bags and much more.

It performs the same as my soft sided and is so versatile with the handle and removable shoulder strap.  I love the blue color and the subtle logo.

"At this time of year, there are holiday Toy Drives at churches, banks, fire stations, police stations -- everywhere! The toys need to be new, unwrapped, and suitable for children or teens.  The problem with this Indoor Basketball Hoop is that it was mailed to me in the toy package itself, not in a shipping box.  The seller pasted all kinds of shipping labels on it and taped the corners with transparent mailing tape.<br /><br />It took me the better part of an hour to clean-up the box to get all of the shipping labels and postage labels removed.  The box itself was plain and black and, except for the logo and a few guidelines about the suggested age of the players, gave no indication of the contents.<br /><br />It would be impossible for volunteers to know what to do with this box.  The outside of the box, now all damaged from removing the shipping labels, had no advertising or illustrations.<br /><br />I opened the box to make sure that all of the contents were intact.  The instructions seemed to show the hoop upside down on the door, but it didn't matter because the contents were very nice, easy to assemble by simply inserting the items into their obvious slots, colorful, and nicely made.<br /><br />I ended-up gifting this purchase to a nine-year-old niece and decided to buy something else for the Toy Drive -- something with a clearly marked toy that would arrive in shrink-wrapped packaging inside the shipping box, as mailed items usually do, and create a fun gift.",0.98,314,44.85714285714285,0.7,2.104

My only problem with the holster was that the retaining strap which snaps in the back, is a little too short and is not a true ""thumb break"".  I had to stretch the retaining strap quite a bit with a little heat from a hair dryer to get it to snap at all, and if you unsnap the strap and pull the gun while wearing the holster, it is almost impossible to snap it back with one hand.  I gave it five stars because it is 99% functional (the strap) and it looks very cool.",0.0176,135,33.75,0.5,2.15528

I keep some in a couple of small 3 ounce spray bottles. It's great for recycling glass jars and other containers.

"These are exactly the same as the Bictmitc brand gloves I previously reviewed back in October. The only difference is the brand name and color of the name on the wrist strap. From the word GEL on the palm to the number of dots on the grippy bits they're identical.<br /><br />Here's that review:<br />""I'm currently confined to a wheelchair and being a big guy I needed some grip and protection when I'm scooting myself around. These gloves seemed to fit the bill and once they arrived they did. Fit was great. Tight enough to stay in place no matter how hard I'm pushing the chair around but not too tight to be uncomfortable. Finger holes are right sized as well. The palms are incredibly grippy and would work as well on a bicycle handlebars as they do gripping the big wheel of my chair. If I had one complaint it's the palm material is tacked onto the glove and are a bit. . . the only way I can describe it as bulky. When you close your hand tight there's more of the grippy stuff than feels necessary but the majority of the time you don't notice the added padding. As wheelchair gloves these are pretty darn good.

"Head and shoulders above the small messenger bag I was using to carry my Sig P365. I had to wax the zipper and I think I'm going to get a better lubricant to make tear open quicker and less stressful on the zippers. Basically you grab the strap above the bag and there's a tab coming out of the top of the main/gun compartment which you pull quickly and forcefully exposing your weapon for quick access. I like the mounting system, basically a Velcro patch with flaps that you tighten around your gun. I found that JUST using the system the bag came with I could not get a 100% solid lock on my gun and it could flop up and down if the bag were shook. The Sig is big enough it couldn't come loose in the bag but I put my leather IWB holster IN the Velcro wrap and now I can still speedily and easily access my pistol and it doesn't bang around inside the bag. This comes with another stitched Velcro loop meant for extremely small firearms. My Sig is considered a micro-compact and the small loop wouldn't cover the trigger guard. It might be big enough for a magazine or an incredibly small pocket revolver. The big strap appears that it would be good for my Sig and all the way up to a full sized 1911 or CZ.<br />There's a TON of storage in this bag. Three zipper compartments on the front. The smallest holds my wallet, the largest which has a built in keyring should you choose to use it will hold my Kindle Paperwhite in an Amazon cloth case. There's a zipper compartment on the top of the strap to hold small things and perhaps your concealed carry permit. There's even a sorta hidden compartment on the back that will take most cell phones, it fits my Galaxy S9 in an OtterBox case just fine. So crazy storage, plenty of room for my Sig P365 with a 12 round extended magazine and extra magazines if I want.<br />There's only a couple things that keep this from being a 5-star bag. First there's no padding on the neck strap and because the strap is stitched on at both ends it's rather hard to add a padded neck strap unless it can be opened and clamped around the strap. Secondly, though I do like the quick access rip-strap I worry about tearing or damaging the zippers and because the strap goes into the gun compartment there's an opening where the tab interrupts the zippers. This can allow dirt and rain to get in the bag. It's not a deal breaker but it is something to be concerned about especially here in Florida where it rains a lot.",-0.8909,509,26.789473684210527,0.7,1.5427300000000002

"When you try to make a tool do everything you make a tool that does nothing really well. This is small and awkward to use.

"I got this package when some friends were over and we all marveled at how thin and crinkly the bags felt. 10 liters of water? In those?

I'm disabled and their weight would have been somewhat dangerous on my walker. I had them put in an unused bathroom's shower figuring if they leaked this would be the best place in the house for that to happen.

"I wanted to like this, I really did! It fit my Sig Sauer P365 but very loosely. That was the first problem I encountered. The grip of the outer material is not in question. It's good. In the waistband either up against skin or underwear the holster stayed in place and allowed for an easy draw. Too easy. The holster also allowed for an easy drop to the floor because it in no way holds tightly to your firearm. I bent over to pick something up and my gun hit the floor! I can't imagine what would have happened had I been out at the store. No matter how I jammed the gun in it just didn't stay securely inside the holster.<br />But my biggest problem. Which was brought up by another user in a Sig owners group, he said ""See if you can squeeze the trigger while it's in the holster."" So I did. . . and I found that it really isn't that difficult to pull the trigger while it holstered. Yes, my firearm does not have a manual safety but other users sang the praises of this holster so I gave it a try. Simply squeezing my pocket caused the striker to drop. I feel a lighter or similar sized and shaped hard object, a key fob even, could cause an accidental discharge.<br />Even if my firearm had a manual safety I honestly couldn't recommend this holster just based on how poorly it retains the weapon.",0.928,287,15.105263157894736,0.1,1.1084
"The bag is nicely padded and there's a semi stiff divider between the section for your weapons and the place to store magazines and ammunition. My chief complaint is there are no straps, which could have easily and cheaply been added, to hold the pistols in the pockets designated for them. If the bag is turned upside down for any reason the pistols can easily come out of the pocket they're stowed in and if you're carrying two as the bag is designed for, they can then bang into one another potentially causing damage to one or both. The divider will keep them from striking the magazines but not from hitting each other. The magazine pouches are, at least now while new, quite tight and hold my 10 and 12 round Sig Sauer P365 magazines tightly in place. Even vigorous shaking didn't dislodge them. The outside pocket had a good size gusset and expands to hold a box of 100 9mm rounds and my Uplula loader with room to spare. It also has a large velcro area for membership patches, flags, etc. The carry handles are comfortable.

"The size is awkward to hold unless you use the handle which feels like rather cheap plastic and I worry it will break rather easily.

"While tempted I haven't zapped myself with this and none of my friends are willing to let me test this on them. It does make a reasonably loud zappy sound when you trigger it but I have no idea how effective it is. What I can report having tested are the flashlight and siren. Flashlight at full charge is good enough to help you find a lock in the dark or something you might have dropped but it's not very bright or focused. Just a dim widely spread beam. I don't think the siren would do much to frighten a criminal away, it's barely loud enough to be annoying. A mugger is likely to just hit you and take it away. It might work as a signal device if you fell and needed help. Another problem with this is all three switches; light, siren and stun gun are pink, the marking icon on the buttons are small and hard to distinguish. In an emergency figuring out which button is which could mean a lot. The siren and stun functionality also have an on/off switch on the base that needs to be activated before either feature can be used (the flashlight function is always available). The big problem with the switch is it stands quite proud of the base and can easily be bumped or nudge on, then you have a live stun gun in your pocket and a button that also easily pressed as you fumble this out of your pocket. I can just imagine resting your hand on your leg and shocking yourself completely by accident. If the 'safety' switch were flush or covered in some way to make it hard to accidentally activate I might have rated it higher. As it stands it's just as dangerous to the owner as it is to a would be attacker, maybe more so.",-0.9633,341,22.73333333333333,0.1,0.54101

"The towel does cool your neck and when it warms up from your body heat, something it does fairly quick because it doesn't breathe, all you need to do is give it a snap in mid air and as long as the towel is reasonably damp it will provide cooling.

Nice display piece for adults or kids alike. Lucite protectors are available and readily affordable. This would look good on a desk or trophy shelf. The ball seems to be the same size as a regulation ball but it's made much differently. The skin is some soft PVC or vinyl material over a sponge core. It's somewhere between a stress relief ball and a real baseball and rather well made. Although the title says 'soft strike' I would only use this for a light game of catch away from roads and other rough surfaces the would easily damage the ball.

"It's a coin flip between three and four stars the headband is a little thin which causes the mask, which really is incredibly soft and does feels like real silk, I picked the black, to press a little harder across the face along the line of the strap. This causes the top and bottom, especially the bottom of the mask, to lift up a small amount. loosening the strap just  little more makes it harder to stay in place but also lets you pull the mask flat on your face and keep out, I'd say, 95+% of the light in the room. Being disabled I enjoy an afternoon nap to help relieve and escape the pain. Most of which leaks in around the blinds. Maybe a little more or firmer padding in the top of the mask might make it fit and feel a little better but it's comfortable enough because I sleep flat on my back all the time. I'd say the mask is quite nice. The mask came with a set of free ear-plugs, which I unfortunately found by far too large to wear.

"My review is of the 5-liter version of the LifeStraw mission water purifier.<br /><br />Assembly and set up are unbelievably easy. Fill the roll-bag with the cleanest water you have access to. Roll, seal and hang the bag using the handy nylon strap they include. Attach the hose (which also easily detaches) and let the water begin to flow. Purge the red valve which is bad water and then wait for the water to begin flowing from the blue valve which is the good water. Detailed instructions are included and printed on the roll-bag. The kit also comes with a handy stuff sack and a couple extra primary filters which mount inside the roll-bag.<br /><br />The 5-liter size is good enough for two people, perhaps two adults and a child. For more people you're going to want the higher capacity bag or more than one of these 5-liter kits. I wanted to give this an honest trial. I almost went with the pool water but the chlorine and other chemicals worried me and after an email from the company I'm glad I didn't. Under no circumstances should you attempt to filter pool water. Luckily we received a good amount of rain. Water drains out of our neighborhood through a system of swales and where it runs across our yard we have a good grass base for it to flow across. We took our bag full of water from the front yard and followed all the instructions very carefully. After purging the red valve and bulb I filled a cup from the blue valve side and. . .  it tasted as good as the filtered water from our refrigerator. 24 hours later and no adverse effects. This has earned my trust and we'll happily be adding it to our hurricane supplies.<br />I received this item in exchange for my review",0.9909,352,17.6,3.0,3.19727
The traditional canteen shape of these bottles bring back childhood camping memories. The new modern materials mean they're lighter won't dent like metal and won't transfer strange flavors to your water. The blue color we purchased is attractive and the textured exterior means a secure grip. The cap is held to the bottle by a decently long tether. We've remove the tether just because they're only being used  in house. These were absolutely perfect for our needs.,0.8305,88,14.666666666666666,0.0,2.24915

"The weights are a bit hard, with my disability,  to adjust the weight on. There's a lot of velcro holding the weights in place. This is a good thing even if it's a bit difficult for me to use.

"[[VIDEOID:5e42242286387ab91d7711c305d00ff0]] As a matter of full disclosure the knife I am reviewing is a replacement for the knife I originally received through the Amazon Vine program. The first knife I received was defective, nearly impossible to open. After contacting the manufacturer they provided a replacement.<br /><br />The knife is fairly attractive as knives go. The nylon handle has a nice raised diamond checkered pattern that looks good and gives a secure grip even when wet. The blade has a nice somewhat dark matte grey finish. There are one or two spots where the matte has been scratched down to bare metal but this is a knife, meant to be used, I expect this to happen. The handle fits my beefy hand quite nicely. I've removed the pocket clip. I have no use for it and it interfered with left-handed operation. If you're left handed and want to use the pocket clip it can, with minimal effort, be switched to the other side. The handle has a beveled spot on both sides near the thumb lugs to facilitate opening.<br /><br />The knife opens lightning fast. There is some effort required to overcome the spring pressure but it isn't excessive. Using my middle finger as opposed to my thumb to open the knife feels more natural and allows me to keep a more secure grip on the knife. It's also faster to be ready to use this way requiring minimal repositioning of the knife and hand after opening.<br /><br />This knife has two locks. Firstly it has a standard liner-lock. This feels reasonably solid and secure and doesn't bind or stick. Secondly it has a sliding lock which clearly shows with red and black colored if the knife is safe or unlocked. This lock works both when the blade is closed and when it's open. Personally I like this feature. You can truly secure the blade when open with no fear of accidentally activating the liner-lock and you can close and lock the knife knowing that it cannot accidentally be opened.<br /><br />Out of the box the blade was sharp enough to shave the hair off my arm with just a bit of grabbing and tugging. I've had sharper knives but I've also had duller ones. This is sharp enough for everyday utility work. The blade is sturdy with a false beveled edge on top. Thick enough that I don't see it bending, flexing or breaking during every day use but thin enough to not be excessively heavy. Balance on the knife is just on the forward part of the slide lock assembly.<br /><br />Although I had to exchange this knife right after receiving it the replacement is all I expected and more. This Coast RX311 is going in my gear bag. I've wanted a knife to take along with me when I'm out wandering around and this fits nicely in my day pack.<br /><br />Note, if you purchase this knife and find it very difficult to open, stop, contact the manufacturer or Amazon and let them know. It shouldn't be that way and you could, as I did with the first knife, injure yourself. Properly functioning this is a rather nice knife.",0.9944,630,21.724137931034484,0.4,2.01832

"This is a great jacket for increasing your heat and sweat output while exercising.<br />Whatever you have on under it will be drenched in sweat.

I slid the end of the straps out of the clasp, threaded them through the back piece, and wrapped them around the console.  After closing the clasps, I adjusted the strap lengths to position the back piece on the top of the console.<br /><br />There was a bit of a hurdle to properly secure the shelf.  There is no hinge in the shelf.  Instead, you adjust the point where the shelf rests on the back piece's support.  It can be a little tricky, but I did not have much trouble getting the shelf to be horizontal.  Total time including removing the shelf, reading the instructions a second time to clarify some points and installing it properly was 15 seconds.<br /><br />The support seems good.  I placed a Dell XPS laptop on the shelf.  I was able to secure it with the strap, and the shelf felt stable.  I was playing movies most of the time, but I also did some typing and scrolling with the touch pad.  I was also easily able to partially close the laptop to see the top of the console.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Easy installation<br />Works as advertised<br />No need to make your own shelf that may or may not work<br />Good size to provide solid support to even large laptops<br />Easily adaptable to many exercise machines<br /><br />CONS:<br />A bit pricy for what you get, but then you save time and money making a shelf<br />Obscures the console, but I can still reach under the shelf to get to the controls okay<br />I do not see it working well with a tablet<br />The strap that holds the laptop covers some of the controls and keyboard (YMMV on this one)<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />This was a good buy.

Great little pump!!! I kept my old one in the back seat of my vehicle and used it multiple times a week for years! I kept it stored in 10 degree weather and upwards to 100+ during the summer months along with sun exposure and it still worked perfectly fine before it was stolen. Every weekend I'll check the tire pressure for one of my four tires on my car and top it off if need be and this works just fine for that.

It stores easily back in the container and can be machine washed. The texture reminds me of the car chamois towels you can use to dry your car. In fact, I think this may be the same thing.

"What a great value!  I bought this three weeks ago and have had used it almost everyday.  I comes almost fully assembled right out of the box.  All you install are the bottom frame, the console and the safety pin used to fold up the treadmill.  It is nice to have two people for assembly, but NOT necessary.  I am a 48 yo female and did just fine alone.  The only slow down I had was that the four bolts attaching the bottom frame were off by about 1/4 inch.  I resolved the issue by loosening the bolt holding the point where the front of the platform attaches to the upright frame.  I loosened it by about 1/4&#34;, allowing the frame to flex and the bottom bolts slid right in.  I then re-tightened the bolt on the platform.  All buttons work, the belt was straight and tight.  I set up my treadmill on carpet, without an equipment pad, and it is very stable.  At 5'6, I can jog on this model just fine.  I love that this is a compact, lightweight, no frills treadmill in my own home and recommend it highly!",0.9629,221,15.785714285714286,0.4,2.4088700000000003

But its supposed to be. When youre a beginner to it, it will be uncomfortable. Ive been using it for 2-3 weeks now & I LOVE it! I place mine on a yoga mat so it doesn't slide around. It really gets rid of the pain in my back & since im in my early 30s it really works! It takes some getting used too thats for sure.

"I've been a Fitbit Blaze owner for a year now and don't have many positive things to say about the device. The device needs a proprietary charger, battery life is mediocre and the app software is very unreliable. There are times the Blaze refuses to connect to my phone and therefore no updates to my daily activities can be recorded. When it does connect to the app/my phone it takes a very long time to eventually upload the data to the app. The band didn't last the year - I had to replace it after 8 months.<br /><br />The thing I do love about it is the ability to invite friends to step challenges... Via the app you can see what your invited  friends, family and acquaintances are doing. You can set up weekday and weekend challenges along with selected popular routes around the world.<br /><br />I blame myself for not liking this product more due to not researching it thoroughly before buying it - had I been aware of its many shortcomings it would have stayed at the clearance rack of the going out of business Macy's sale.<br /><br />I'm looking to either get a better wearable fitness device or just use the step monitor on my Huawei Mate 9 (which seems more accurate anyways).",0.9172,253,36.142857142857146,0.1,1.1051600000000001

While this lid makes it very easy to sip water from my Hydro Flask wide mouth 40 oz container there is the unwelcome taste of plastic emanating from the straws. I've washed the straws in every solution I could think of and that taste will not subside. I went back to the old flip top (which restrict your sipping level to almost a trickle).<br /><br />I washed the straws prior to use and several times afterwards yet I cannot remove that taste... if not for that this would be a 5 star product. The purpose of the stainless steel bottle is to remove the possibility of odors and smell... to find that the straw adds that element back is disappointing.<br /><br />If anyone has a solution for this please let me know... if I try it and it works I will change my review.

I am a big iced tea drinker yet began to stop drinking so much after finding the taste of my home brewed green tea lately not so good.  I was using BPA-free plastic containers to make and store the tea in when I came across an article about using glass for a much purer taste.<br /><br />I searched Amazon and came across these bottles.  The price was right (cheaper than the manufacturer's website price) and the user ratings pretty good.  Combining these bottles with a glass Pyrex measuring cup to make the tea I have noticed an immediate improved taste.  I allow the tea to cool before pouring it into the bottles (I read if you place the tea in when it's hot the cap might seal so tightly you may have difficulty opening the bottle) and it tastes great now!<br /><br />I use 3 bottles for tea and the other three for water (which also tastes much better vs. BPA-free plastic).  I am planning to get a small fridge for another room and will buy another case of these bottles to store tea and water in.,0.9295,216,36.0,0.0,2.27885

"Wonderful little light.  I live in the country and occasionally loose power, usually for an hour or so.  I could have read by the amount of light which was cast by this little light.  I purchased it in September of 2012 and never had a significant power outage until last night [last night lasted six hours].  It provided enough light to dimly illuminate the living room and enough to read if necessary.  I have a Kindle Paperwhite, so reading was not an issue, but the amount of light was comforting and certainly this lantern is safer than the kerosene lamps which I have been forced to use in the past.  The hanger worked great as I placed the lantern on the arm of the gooseneck reading lamp that I normally use. Small, compact and easy to have in an accessible space to be ready [fully charged] in case of an outage.  Do figure out how to turn it one BEFORE you need it, as the switch is a bit difficult to work. The switch is somewhat hidden which makes the lantern water-resistant. Would work great in a tent when camping.  Plan to buy a second one to put in another room.<br />12/18/2015 --- Only used this light for power outages and the charge light went to red and the light no longer works.

"Bought for a multipurpose camping mug, because I wanted something big enough for anything, and very light and cheap enough that if it gets damaged or lost I won't care.

"These are admittedly a good deal--if all 5 work. If only 4 work, it's not. Unfortunately this was the case. Only 4 actually worked. I dropped a note to the seller explaining I tried good batteries which worked fine in the other 4 flashlights, but one flashlight simply would not work. I explained I had tried several different batteries which were known to be good. Unfortunately, there seems to be a language barrier with the seller. After this detailed explanation about trying several different batteries the seller proceeded to ask me ...wait for it... if I had batteries in the flashlight.<br /><br />(*facepalm*)<br /><br />The seller then went on to ask me to take VIDEO of the flashlight not working and upload it so they could see it. Seriously? For a $2.50 item? I'm sorry, but my time is more valuable than that. I ended up just tossing the defective flashlight. The seller ended up refunding a few bucks for the defective flashlight though, so I aded a star back on for that. The other four work fine.<br /><br />Note the focal adjuster moves very easily--there is little to no friction to hold in in place. This makes the flashlight useless in terms of self-defense, as the semi-sharp front edge moves too easily to be either safe or effective. You are more likely to pinch or cut your hands on the mechanism while trying to use it as it moves and rotates quite freely. Other similar tactical flashlights I own have a slightly different design to the focal mechanism and significant effort is required to move them--meaning they stay put, as they should. This is a very cheap product. Align your expectations accordingly.",0.8564,345,18.157894736842103,0.0,1.4569200000000002

"Initially I was fascinated with the notion we now have decent fitness trackers with limited smartwatch capabilities for $25-$30. Well, that idea went into the trash almost immediately, as I became acquainted with what the Wyze band can and more importantly--cannot--do. The Wyze band is a lot of things, and great isn't one of them.<br /><br />First, let me say, clearly, that for $25 or $30, this is a hard device to beat. If you keep your expectations (very) low, in line with the very low price of the unit, you will not be disappointed. The biggest frustration initially was with the lack of clear, helpful instructions. The instructions tell you it is charged out of the box, and that you should plug it in to charge to activate it. Um, okay. The home bar pulses when it is plugged in to the charger, leading you to think it is charging. Perplexingly, there is no charge indicator in the default display configuration while it is charging, so you just think it is still charging. In fact, pretty much everything in the default factory configuration is disabled, including Alexa, even once you set up your Alexa info in the app. Notifications are disabled by default, so nothing talks to the band. You have to turn on notifications, and then scroll through the entire list of all the apps on your phone to enable notifications for each specific app, including calendar reminders, messages, etc. Problem is, nowhere in the documentation (even online) does it tell you this step is necessary. People who are not comfortable messing around with their devices will be frustrated quickly. Nothing is intuitive, and there is no real guidance. It's fiddle-around time--geeks (like me) will be comfy with this. The average consumer will not be impressed at all, and may become quite frustrated.<br /><br />However, set up frustrations aside, it's the things the Wayz band lacks which may disappoint the consumer. It's a long list, but again, remember this thing is dirt cheap. To begin with, the band has no external speaker. This means Alexa’s responses, when you can raise them (which is by no means assured), are in text on the screen in a *tiny* font.  In fact, this tiny font is everywhere. If you wear glasses for reading, you will definitely need them to use this band. This means if you are out walking or running, and you're not wearing your glasses, the band is almost useless. This is where not having a speaker is a real detriment: Alexa cannot speak responses, and without my glasses I can't read them. This is due to the very small screen which is  only 240 x 120 pixels. There simply isn't enough screen real estate for a larger font. This screen is *tiny*, and feels about half the size of the screen on an Apple watch. Another design issue worth noting, the band is the cheapest design I have ever seen, and it both looks and feels like it. The plastic clasp feels like it may break at any moment. Also, if you have large wrists like I do, you’re potentially out of luck. The Wayz band ships with only one band, and no larger band seems to be available.<br /><br />You cannot really interact with this band much, which limits functionality. You can read your incoming text messages and notifications in that teeny tiny font, but you can't reply (or if you can, I've no idea how, as this is not covered anywhere and doesn't seem to be possible). You also cannot dismiss all notifications at once, and will have to scroll through all of them, dismissing them one at a time. A word to the wise: be conservative about which apps you allow to send notifications to the band. If you are all in, you are going to spend a LOT of time dismissing notifications. With the exception of talking to Alexa, which requires you to touch the screen, communication with this band is almost entirely one-sided--you cannot input anything on the band at all, and you must use the app on your phone to interact with it--which begs the question… why am I wearing this again?<br /><br />Wyze have also not included the ability to control music playback (or anything else) from your phone. With the exception of the heartbeat monitor and sleep tracker, this device primarily functions as a tiny supplemental screen for your phone to give you alerts (and the haptic buzz is STRONG). From what I can tell, the sleep tracking, step counter, and heart rate monitoring are far from accurate, rendering this device mostly useless. Also, if your activity of choice is not walking, running, or jogging, you’re out of luck--it can’t track anything but steps and heart rate, and as it seems to consistently get those wrong, it really does sort of feel like a waste of $30. Perhaps more than anything else, the Wyze band serves as a great advertisement for other, superior fitness trackers, as all the shortcomings of this device just make me want to get a really good fitness tracker/smartwatch and toss this thing.<br /><br />It should be noted there is also as serious issue with the way the band communicates with the phone. This really was not well-designed at all on the app side. In order for the band to interact with your phone, the WYZE app MUST be running on your phone at all times. This has several implications: 1) security (it can potentially capture everything you do on your phone), 2) it munches up phone battery, and 3) if you close the app, nothing will work, including Alexa. This is *really* uncool, and has contributed significantly to my decision to return it and spend a bit more on another, superior fitness tracker instead. It’s going back.",0.9927,1199,26.64444444444445,0.9,0.9678100000000001

"I have always worn either Rawlings or LS batting gloves, and this one is almost as comfy as most, but with this latest redesign, they have added seams across the fingers. I would think they would know better--this is never a good idea, but they did it anyway. Feels pretty good, but wearing it for a prolonged length of time inside a baseball glove (which I do) may result in discomfort. The raised LV logo on the back is bigger (taller) than before and gets in the way a little, and the fabric and leather feel thinner (especially in the palm), which is not necessarily a good thing (again, especially in the palm). Time will tell how well it stands up to use (doesn't feel as high quality as the last generation). The wrist portion doesn't look wider, but it feels stiffer, and is definitely more supportive, but feels less comfortable and impedes wrist motion slightly compared to the old version. LV needs to stop changing things just for the sake of change. The latest changes have impacted functionality significantly, and at least to me, the previous glove felt better. I have attached a photo to this review of both gloves side by side. The old design is on the left. You can clearly see the horizontal seams across the fingers, and the wider wrist band on the new glove, which is on the right. 3.5 stars.",0.9492,278,23.166666666666668,0.0,1.48476

"This is a brilliant idea. Saves a lot of time--you can do your own wraps quickly and easily. Two things you need to know before ordering this product:<br /><br />1) These are meant to be worn inside boxing gloves. Do not try to use them for any sort of direct contact or a) you may injure yourself or others, and b) they will be destroyed quickly. Use them as they were intended and you will be quite pleased with the results.<br /><br />2) There should be a sizing chart on here. These are meant to be very snug-fitting. I ordered a size large, and they were huge. I returned them for medium. I have average-size hands, and figured large should do the trick. Nope. These are meant to fit tightly.<br /><br />---<br />UPDATE: The wrist wrap has started coming apart where it was attached to the glove. I had to sew it back together--I used high-quality dental floss, which is indestructible. One of the ends of the ""fingers"" is coming apart. This is due to trying to remove them--they are VERY hard to take off after a workout. They fit snugly (like a second skin), and it takes several minutes to work each hand off without tearing them. Even so, one of the fingers is still coming apart. I still like these--they feel good on, but when they finally do die, I think I may switch to traditional wraps.",0.5161,308,18.11764705882353,0.2,1.4148300000000003

"I've used this pad a few times now and every time I've been disappointed.  Sleeping after a long day backpacking is always welcomed.  I wanted to see how well this mat would perform but so far I've yet to have a good experience with it.  In most cases, it will lose air.  Nothing has punctured the pad and I see no air leaks if I attempt to do bubble tests and whatnot on it but for some reason I inevitably will end up waking up on the ground.  Even when it is fully inflated, it's not the most comfortable pad.  The hexagons sound like a great idea but the reality is if you're kneeling on it or have an elbow on it, odds are you're going to kneel or rest your elbow on the ground in the gaps between the hexagons.  Filling it with air is no different than any of the other pads of this style.  Takes time but great that you do not need to carry around anything extra.

I mostly mountain bike so inevitably something will break on my or my friend's bikes and having this many tools at my disposal in a neat little kit is great for keeping us on the trails instead of having to call it a day when something minor happens.",0.8607,152,19.0,0.0,2.25821
I have a few of these inflatable pillows and these aren't terrible but they're not the best by any means.  It's nice that they come as a pair however they do not stay in place at all for me.  No matter what I try to do they just slide their way out from under me.  On my last camping trip I just gave up on them and went back to my normal pillow which does a better job at staying in place.  Much like other inflatable pillows they do fill up and compress down quite easily.  Once it was filled with air there was no leakage or anything.  If it had a better means of staying in place I would have given it a far better review but I spent more time with my head off of the pillow than I did on the pillow any time I would take it with me.,0.9464,163,23.285714285714285,0.0,1.4839200000000001
"So this sleeping pad is by no means light.  If you're the type of backpacker that's going the ultralight route, this is not for you.  If, however, you are the type that likes to camp in tents but drive to your campsite, this pad works nicely.  We have two sleeping pads in this house.  One is the style with all the hexagons and then there's this.  The hexagon style was so uncomfortable but this style is very comfortable.  Even my wife enjoyed sleeping on it and she is not a fan of sleeping on the ground by any means.  Inflating them can feel like a chore at times.  It takes time but the fact you can fill it with your foot and need no extra devices / tools is great.  Definitely recommend for the camper that drives to the site but still loves sleeping in tends.  I do not recommend it for backpacking because there are lighter NS and more compact alternatives out there which are just as comfortable albeit typically more expensive.",0.9838,191,17.363636363636363,0.0,2.29514
So I had a set of trekking poles for myself and I figured I would grab a set for my 8 year old son.  He's been using them on hikes and he says he enjoys the extra stability while walking uneven terrain.  From a build perspective they feel sturdy enough for a child.  Your standard attachments come with them.  The coloring is nice and bright to keep them from getting misplaced.  All in all they are a decent product and I'd recommend them.  The hardest part was getting my child to use them vs just carrying them.,0.9118,106,15.142857142857142,0.0,1.8735400000000002
"So I can't say I've run water through this bottle and then tested the quality of the water afterwards, but I have used it plenty of times with varying qualities of water.  It's not my go to bottle for water drinking when I'm using tap or filtered water.  I'll just grab a bottle that can hold more.  However, on a few of my camping and hiking trips, I took this with me.  It worked well.  What I can say is, I've used it to filter water that I've got out of a few questionable ponds and at no point did I get sick.  The water tested the same as if it were through other filtering methods.  So my anecdotal review is that it does it's job well.  My only problem is that the bottle size is pretty small.  I wish I had got a larger version.",-0.1154,168,16.8,0.0,1.96538
"I'm old school.  All of the clamps I've used have been your traditional metal spring style clamps.  When I saw these I was a little hesitant because I didn't know how secure they would be.  I've used them on my Olympic bars and have not had a single issue with weights sliding out of place.  They snap on easily and come back off just as easy.  My weight set is outside and I'm curious how they will hold up over time to changes in weather but so far I have no complaints.  Definitely recommend if you're looking for a replacement for lost spring clamps (which was my problem).  Don't know that I would purchase these if you already have working clamps.

"First off I'll preface by saying I mountain bike frequently.  I ride with higher end equipment usually and my pedal of choice has always been the DMR Vault.  Expensive, I know.  So I've had experience with quality pedals.  I've also had experience with crappy plastic pedals that come with bikes or a step above those.  With all that being said, for the price, these pedals are actually not that bad.  I do not use them on my mountain bike.  I did, however, put them on my BMX bike and I have to say, I can't really complain about them yet.  They feel durable enough.  The pegs are adequate.  They're far better than some of the 20 dollar plastic pairs of pedals out there.  So if you're looking for a cheaper pedal to get you by but the quality is still there, these are a good option.  I can't speak to how long they'll last as I've only been using them for a short period of time but so far I  have no problem recommending these if you don't want to fork out a bunch of money on pedals.",0.8439,218,16.76923076923077,0.0,1.85317

"I would like to give this tent a good review but in reality I feel it's lacking in some areas.  Areas which could easily be addressed.  First and foremost, there is no way you are getting 5/6 people in this tent unless you're laying on top of each other.  I'd rate this tent at 3-4 max.  It was fine for my 8 year old, myself, and my dog but I could not imagine trying to squeeze more than 1 more person in there.<br /><br />The tent leaks.  This past trip I took it rained for an hour.  The rain started out heavy and within the first 10 minutes I could already see water pooling below the doorway zipper.  The corners of the tent also took in some water but nearly as bad as the doorway.  Thankfully it only rained heavy for about 30 minutes.  I laid a couple dirty shirts on the floor near the zipper to collect the water but I have strong doubts this tent would hold up to heavy rain for extended periods of time.<br /><br />Another issue I have, which isn't a huge one since this is the case with a lot of cheaper tents, are the ties for where you tie the rain fly to the poles and at the top.  It's just a pain to get to and tie the knots.<br /><br />I would probably steer clear of this tent if you're expecting inclement weather.",0.2161,284,25.818181818181817,0.0,1.2648300000000001
"So I picked up this chair because I need something sturdy.  I'm not a huge fan of the bag chairs which usually end up becoming uncomfortable to me.  I love this chair, but maybe not as much as my neighbor.  Every time I bring the thing out to our neighborhood get togethers he sits in it and I never see it again.<br /><br />It is quite a comfortable chair.  The height is right.  The feel is good.  It definitely feels sturdy.  The addition of the table on the side is nice, however, I already ran into one issue with mine.  One of the plastic tabs you push to lock the table in place broke.  It didn't even take much force for it to happen.  Not sure what caused that.  With that being said, it's not even a needed piece.  It's your typical metal hinge where you just push it and it folds on itself so don't let that be a determining factor on your purchase.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this chair.",0.9549,208,16.0,0.1,2.31647
"So this is very similar to the stainless steel water bottles I pick up at Walmart.  The bottle construction is fine.  It has kept my beverages cold enough for my liking, but I do have a few small gripes with it.  First off, the mouthpiece is too small in diameter in my opinion.  I feel like you really have to purse your lips to drink from this thing.  My other water bottles have larger diameter mouthpieces and you can really notice the difference between this bottle and others.  My second issue was that there was some jagged plastic at the hinge for the handle.  The quality of the lid almost makes me feel like someone just 3D printed it and slapped it on a bottle.  All in all it's not a bad water bottle but definitely not my favorite.",0.9162,151,16.77777777777778,0.0,1.87486

Assembly was difficult (directions poorly written with bad English) and the folding release handle will not latch when the folding handle is in the upright position.

This is impractical however because it requires partial disassembly and reassembly each time by unbolting the side arms every time you wish to fold or unfold it.<br /><br />When the treadmill was powered on the motor makes a grinding sound (see my video).<br /><br />Due to the motor sounds and damaged side board I requested a refund through Amazon and found out I would have to pay to ship back the defective treadmill.

I put these on my Yamaha G9 golf cart. They attached fairly easily and they add a solid level of safety to the cart. I enjoy the fact that these retract like traditional seatbelts versus the over the body approach the you set and forget (which then dangles off the cart at times).<br /><br />I had no issue with assembly and my only real slight knock is that the clips where the belt buckles into are just slightly too long. I am not able to set them back further otherwise they will seat too far back. A nice upgrade would also be a bushing so these can swivel a little bit (I just left them slightly loose from the supplied locknut) that way it's not too stiff for anyone using the belts.<br /><br />Great product overall though!,0.9272,162,32.4,0.0,1.87816
"My son just started soccer and the other started teeball and you are probably thinking what does this have to do with speed and agility? Everything.<br /><br />I needed something fun but also challenging for them because it became more of a training game than training.<br /><br />Hurdles:<br />These are tricky but friendly in that they hold up well, especially for when you are moving over them quickly. I enjoy these for building rebounding strength for explosiveness. The kids were not big fans because they can be tedious to not tag one with your foot.<br /><br />Cones:<br />We did zig zags as well as 4 corners and a T drill. These drills help more with being reactive and help with bursts after a transition. You can improve on these in terms of improving time but the focus really should be on building the ability to move quickly (especially moving laterally - sideways).<br /><br />Ladder:<br />Think of being light on your feet and getting used to pushing off the ball of your foot. Fast feet is the key. This is like the cone drill where being good at this specific obstacle doesn't help much but as part of being ""quick"" repetition does help (that may sound counterintuitive). If it helps with anything other than fast feet, it's the ability to not trip over your own feet as you are moving around the field of play.<br /><br />Jump Rope:<br />Helps build coordination and feeling like you are training like Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />Resistance Bands:<br />These are great for building hip strength but ideal to use during the warmup phase versus active training.<br /><br />Obstacle Ball:<br />This helps really build hand-eye coordination and a solid floor is key (along with keeping your parents lamps out of the way).<br /><br />Parachute:<br />Parachute training tends to look cooler than it is BUT this was THE MOST FUN part of getting my kids to enjoy training. We did this part of the ""obstacle"" course last. They loved watching the chute burst open and each other running in slow motion.<br /><br />Sorry for the instruction but it was also how I helped my kids understand getting their feet moving and the goal.

"I found that the packaging was a lot of the work when getting this project started. It seems they really focused on this as others mentioned issues with packaging.<br /><br />The directions are better than most, but still not perfect. It does show you what to do but the explanations are missing depth. Overall I'd rate this as an intermediate level of expertise. A lot of that expertise is going to come from removing some of the equipment from the golf cart (versus the assembly of the seat to the golf cart).<br /><br />I was not thrilled with the thinner material (I purchased a seat for a previous golf cart that had a bit thicker steel and the seats were a bit more durable). The seats do need self tapping screws to install into the thin diamond plate steel but it does look good. The handle that comes with the seat seems to provide structural support for the thinner steel rather than convenience. Though it does provide a more secure look to the cart.<br /><br />IMPORTANT PART: The bigger issue I'm having now that it's all assembled is more and more cities are requiring rear seats to have seat belts. I had planned to install them as I did on my prior seat on my previous cart. That seat had bolt holes that seemed to plan for seat belts. This does not have holes for the belts and trying to find reasonable areas on the seat or cart aren't working. It seems like I'll be tapping some new holes to get those installed.<br /><br />Outside of that I still did rate this well as it is a good looking seat once on the cart.

This little game arrived today and I was very excited to set it up which was super simple. It came with the board and 4 “darts”. The only issue setting it up was getting the darts untied from each other.<br /><br />The board is very basic in structure being that it has a plastic back ring that is covered by felt fabric. I don’t think it will take long before the fabric starts to fray and make the board not work properly anymore (time and use will tell).<br /><br />The kids LOVED it though and that was the best part.

"You bought a golf cart, but you need that rear seat. You see this listing on Amazon and can't wait for it to arrive. The good news is that it arrives fairly quickly and in pristine packaging, excellent. There are 2 boxes, one has the structural components, the other has the pads... sure.<br />You open box 1 for all of the structural components to be laid out and to get your project started. No sense getting the seat pads dirty so you leave box 2 sealed up. After separately out the somewhat accurately described bolt kit labels, you decide to get started. Removing the old pieces from your cart is somewhat of a detailed process and is mostly accurate. DO save all of those pieces just in case (pro tip, there will be a just in case).<br />You've got the cart in the state it needs to be to begin your assembly. As you begin to use the available bolts you start to loosely piece this thing together so sooner or later it looks like a cart seat. The problem here is that several bolts are not found, you need to open box 2 to find those because they are in there when it was close to 5 o'clock on a Friday and that box wasn't sealed before heading out the door at the Modz warehouse.<br />Anyways, you've now probably got all your nuts and bolts for the cart and a few have loosened up inside your head trying to figure this out. Most of the pieces will line up properly, though attaching the post to the old seat back slot might not work because they weren't fully drilled out like mine. This is where the old bolts come into play (that's not on Modz though).<br />You are loosely assembling most of the pieces only to find out that the bolts they provided are kind of accurately labeled for proper measurements. It would've been better to just use a metric ruler though because some bolts ended up where they didn't below. The good news is that you've got some extra bolts you didn't use because you used some of the old bolts. Unfortunately, those are the shortest bolts of the kit so you can't use them anyways. Now you've got some sick spare bolts for some future project that may or may not require them.<br />Once you go to attach the arm rest to the base of the cart you realize the available bolts will be too long so you can't properly open up the seat to turn into a flat bed. This is where the extra washers come into play (don't worry there's somewhere between 10-67 extra washers) so you can shore up the bolt head so there's less available thread on the end. This helps make sure that the bed opens up properly because you are about ready to lay down anyways. The rest of the assembly goes fairly smooth, though getting the seat back supports off the old Club Car DS is super fun since the nut is buried inside of a channel where only a small team of your kids' GI Joe's tools could fit. Once you've turned into Superman to bend that aluminum enough to gap and get the bolt head secure and the incredibly precise angle of your pliers to free up that seatback support you are home free.<br />From there it's only a few more screws before you are done with a project that you estimated to take about 45 minutes lasted nearly 3 hours.<br />Cheers!

"When you think of fitness, the flex comes to mind. When you think of equipment, flex is the last thing you generally want in an item.<br /><br />The design seems to miss on this unit. The bolt setup should not have rounded heads that sit into a groove in the metal. Washers for all bolts are essential. Locknuts can be a nice bonus.<br /><br />The unit is fairly high off the ground which makes the flex more noticeable. This is all from a 165lb individual. I end up gripping close to where the handles attach to the machine so there is less potential for flex. I also ended up getting different bolts since the originals started to eat into the metal.<br /><br />In the words of Wayne from Letterkenny, Hard no.",0.4939,163,20.375,0.3,0.63817
The unit has a solid overall build. The welds are decent. The design isn’t sloppy and uneven. The paint seemed to all be intact.<br />The wheels were ok to assemble and the only real assembly to the unit. They roll like cheap rollerblade wheels so if the unit were lighter it would be a bigger problem. The drag the wheels create end up being something that does cause the unit to roll uneven at times (rather than a strength imbalance causing this).<br />I do like this overall and would recommend it to others.,0.875,112,18.666666666666668,0.3,1.9525000000000001

"This is definitely a budget bar so do not be fooled in terms of getting a good deal.<br /><br />The pros are that it handles quite a bit of weight without issue (405 total thus far) and there was limited whip in the bar. The knurl is decent, but nothing to write home about if you want good knurl. The other big pro is this is the perfect beater bar. Use it on your landmine attachment or for barbell complexes before getting into your real working weights on another bar.<br /><br />The cons are that it barely fits olympic plates on to the sleeves because they weren't machined down enough. It makes for an incredibly snug fit. The other issue is that the rings on the bar aren't spaced out normally. They are about 2-3 inches (each way, 4-6 in total) further in than other bars.

"CAP did right by these handles. The previous pair I had from a different brand cracked at the twist locking end and became unusable.

I've tried using different modalities to loosen the area and buy space for additional ROM that is pain free or nearly pain free. The hammy band has definitely helped in that regard because it provides that additional tension on the troubled area WHILE being in motion. This has allowed the muscle to free up and the nerve to move properly as well (less tingly pain lately).<br /><br />I do use this for every leg session and have been able to return to light squatting after 3 years of problems coupled with &#34;solutions&#34; that always failed after weeks of consistent practice.<br /><br />Hammy Band ftw,-0.8305,195,32.5,0.1,1.78085
"The bar is not what you would expect. There is a reason why this bar is quite a bit cheaper than other bars. You will see flaws that you won't expect to see. The weld for the center swivel piece (what connects the bar to a cable) is offcenter. This is not a micrometer level of off-center, but an inch off center.

"[[VIDEOID:8d83bdf8884e4adb2ceeb83f1712e4b4]] I have done a full video review on these (while holding an L-sit position, well for a portion of the review anyways), on youtube.<br />**EDIT: The same video linked to this review.**<br /><br />These came in very nice packaging and it also includes a carrying bag. I've found the carrying bag to be useful for other items in my home gym (i.e. foam roller, straps, etc).<br /><br />There is 20' of decent thickness straps to attach to the rings. I was VERY impressed at the density of the rings. I was expecting them to be similar to standard PVC (not sure why, just what I was thinking). These rings are solid and almost sound like wood when you clang them together. These are also quite large, which is perfect to aid in wrist stablity as your forearm will balance against the top of the ring once in the top position (of a dip or l-sit or similar).<br /><br />The setup is incredibly easy as long as you have something high enough to attach them. I have a high ceiling basement and attached it to the steel crossbeam. I can't do a standard muscle up on them, however a kneeling version will definitely happen! I really like that there are little markers on each strap so you can accurately determine the proper height of each strap (to ensure they are both equal length).<br /><br />The strap buckle is quite heavy duty as well and the feeder space (to fit the strap through) is quite narrow so it grips rather well. It's also NOT plastic, which is a huge reason for providing additional stars. I prefer to be a budget shopper and that's why I landed on these rings. They weren't priced insanely high. They fit within my budget and the materials are all high quality. A plastic buckle is a disaster, but I've seen them around and fear for the outcome of that disaster.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy them as much as I am!<br />-LiftingDad",0.97,435,27.1875,0.8,2.5309999999999997

My official review on YouTube is a 3.5 but half stars don't fly on Amazon. For a video version check this out: https://youtu.be/abd0bJ7ZMiQ<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Cost.<br />-Shipping speed.<br />-Quality with cost factored in.<br />-Works well for home gym purposes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Awful instructions.<br />-Adjustability is limited.<br />-Light commercial would be a stretch based on the design of the ankle supports.<br /><br />The cons are a bit strong because the instructions are not step by step. It's basically a build sheet so some trial and error will occur when assembling. The bolts are not clearly labeled/defined so deciphering between them is somewhat of a guess. Other than the ankle support and adjustability this could be light commercial but the ankle support is very wobbly. The adjustability is limited as well even for a hyperextension (I'm 5'8&#34; and use the closest notch). To do GHRs I'd have to drill a few more holes around 4 inches closer.<br /><br />Overall it's a solid buy and I'd recommend its purchase based on the price.

"I have waited to review this bar for awhile as I wanted to test it over time as bars tend to take a beating rather quickly. This bar has not been dropped, though I have failed a few squats in which I had to dump off my back around 2 ft from the pins. No issues with bar bending during those times. I've had 495lb on the bar so far and the bar does flex a little (as expected) but it retains it's flat shape once the bar is unloaded. I use this bar personally 4-5 times per week for mostly powerlifting so it handles heavier loads quite well. I cannot vouch for the 1000lbs capacity though.<br /><br />I have not had issues with splinters from the bar, nor had any issues when receiving the bar. I've now had this bar for around 5 years without any complaints and it's a bar I use daily.<br /><br />There is no center knurl which makes it an ideal bar for the average user as well as the avid weightlifting doing oly lifts (and not wanting center knurl). I was able to combat this though with some black athletic tape which doesn't really stick out much from the bar and really helps replace the lack of center knurl (which I do normally prefer).<br /><br />Still a great bar to this day with no bent aspect nor any real maintenance other than maybe a once a year spritz with 100% silicone.

Considering that this device claims to work with 6 1/2 inch hats and was a very tight fit for the next size up from that I subtracted a star. Hey, it works perfectly once I shoe horned it into my hat, but if you wear anything less than a 7 I advise looking for a different product.

"I received this as a free review sample. The reason why I subtracted a star is neither an iPhone 6+ with a ruggedized case nor a Note 4 with a folio case would fit until they were removed from those cases.  Even then the fit was snug. Another issue is the zipper for the long pocket is somewhat flimsy.<br /><br />Those aside, this is a thick, padded belt that is both comfortable and built to last (except for the aforementioned zipper.) I would have preferred a more universal velcro adjustment and fastening design than the specific size format that uses a little elasticity and requires you to slip it on.  But that is a personal preference.<br /><br />The storage, aside from the phone issue, is more than sufficient for most folks. You can cram a men's wallet, keys and other things into the pockets. There are no washing instructions, but I would personally hand wash this in a mild solution of Woolite and air dry. It may be able to withstand machine washing, but I would not chance it.<br /><br />One final note: the reflective strips would be more effective had they been a little larger, but I did test them in headlights and they can be seen up to ten or so meters, so there is a margin of safety.",0.9547,264,29.33333333333333,0.0,1.8864100000000001
"I received this as a free review sample. The reason why I subtracted a star is the bottle has a seam on both sides, indicating that it was made from two halves that were 'welded' together. I have owned bottles made this way that split when accidentally dropped when full or nearly full.<br /><br />The main features are capacity and large infusion basket. A major plus is that it effectively seals, so there is no need to worry about spills or leakage. It has a silicone 'O' ring on the cap, as well as a silicone stopper on the top that deals the drinking spout.<br /><br />Do note that you CANNOT clean this is a dishwasher. However, hand washing and air drying are quick and easy.<br /><br />The infusion basket holds a fair amount of ingredients. It appears to have been designed for citrus or pulpy fruit (such as apple) wedges.  It will also accommodate most larger berries, although if you intend to add blueberries, I recommend arranging them in the center of the ingredients because when cut to release their juices parts can escape into the main chamber of the bottle. Also, the drinking spout is large and small ingredients will flow out.  For me I like that and view it as a feature, but some folks may not care for that characteristic.<br /><br />One thing to note is the release button only opens the cap after you have disengaged a U-shaped metal bail. There is no illustration of that in the instructions that are printed on the box, so if you are unfamiliar with this kind of mechanism you may be frustrated the first time you use it. I discovered this when a friend was toying with the bottle and complained that she could not open the lid.<br /><br />Overall, this has high capacity going for it, and it is absolutely leak-proof. You cannot use hot liquids in it, and the seam I mentioned above are concerns.",-0.7187,396,30.46153846153846,0.0,1.38439
"I received  this as a free review sample. For some reason I am drawn to survival kits such as this. The two most useful tools (to me) are the fire starter and the saw. However, in a true survival situation everything in the kit will probably prove useful, and some may even make a big difference.<br /><br />Also useful is the paracord itself. It is not designed for climbing and supporting your weight, but will definitely allow you to lash together a shelter. Ironically, the implements are inside the paracord pouch, so the ziplock style bag becomes storage for as many of those as you can cram. Frankly, I think that the cardboard box that this comes in should be retained for better storage (albeit not very waterproof.)<br /><br />This is obviously a collection of last resort tools that belong in bug-out bags and emergency kits.

"I received this as a free review sample.  Since the product specs are very detailed I am not going to repeat them, but will say that they are pretty accurate based on my testing them for over six hours.<br /><br />One thing that is missing from the product specs is this lantern is easily water resistant in rain and wet environments. The cover for the USB port is effective. That is not to say that it would work submerged in water for more than a few inches, but in a storm it definitely works well. One big feature that I like is it uses a micro USB port to charge. Contrast that with a lot of lights (solar and conventional) that employs a USB cable with a barrel type connector. Those kinds will work from a standard charger, but you are out of luck if you lose that cable while camping or damage it in an emergency unless you are one of the rare folks who has a spare. With this one you can use any micro USB cable.<br /><br />To set expectations, this is meant to be solar charged in emergencies. That takes forever. Well, every hour yields .25 to .5 hours of use time, depending on your brightness setting. Also, this is not a super bright light on the highest setting. It is more than sufficient for emergency illumination and the flash function can be seen from afar, but it is not strong enough for detailed inspections, reading and similar activities.<br /><br />For me the compact, light form factor, water resistance,  and the fact that it uses a standard micro USB port are its best features. If it has any Achilles heel, it's the hanging hook that seems a little on the fragile side and will accommodate a rod (or twig) about 3/16ths an inch in diameter. Based on price versus features, though, I still felt that it rated five stars given similar products.",0.858,381,27.214285714285715,0.3,2.3474

The entire set fit nicely, along with a hand held microphone, a few patch cables and spare batteries.<br /><br />The case ships with two 2-inch thick layers of egg crate style foam and a separate 1-inch layer of regular foam that can be cut out.

"I received these as a free review sample. I also own a different pair of gloves from this company, which were snug and form fitting. For these I requested a size larger than the chart (in the product photos) shows and the fit was very good, although the fingers were slightly longer. Since I purposely requested a larger size, the finger length was to be expected.<br /><br />Adjustment is from a velcro strap on the top side of the wrist band. I was able to get an otherwise perfect fit by adjusting that. While these are designed for cycling they work well as car driving and even work gloves. There is excellent grip on the textured index and middle digits, and the overall feel provides more dexterity than I would have guessed. I could perform just about any detailed task except typing while wearing them. I could even get some (but not total) accuracy when swiping the screen of my tablet. I was NOT able to use the screen keyboard on my phone, but that was expected.<br /><br />When I mentioned that these are multi-purpose, they are not designed (nor will last long) of you are using them to handle rough objects like fire wood, bricks and the such. I doubt they would last an hour in that role, but for cycling, driving and handling smooth objects they should last years.<br /><br />Bottom line: do check the chart in the product photos and measure your hand accordingly.

"I received this as a free review sample. I'll get the reason why I docked it a star out of the way first: this mirror is on a long, thin boom and tends to bounce. The length of the boom is fixed, although that is not a problem for me. For others it may be. It's the combination of slight optical distortion and the jitter from the bounce that I dislike.<br /><br />On the other hand this is a great safety feature despite the issues I mentioned. Also, part of the distortion I cited is because the mirror is more like a reflective plastic that is not likely to shatter in the event of an accident. It takes getting accustomed to, but it does allow me to see behind me and partially to the side. That is due to the ability to adjust it to just about any angle you desire.<br /><br />Installation is easy, but the anchoring velcro pad is a bit on the flimsy side. This is easy to correct - just purchase and cut another piece of velcro and use your own adhesive. Bottom line: this is a nice safety feature that can  be improved upon.

"I received this as a free review sample. There are a few reasons why I rated this lantern so highly, but the two major ones are brightness and compactness. Ranking right up there, too, is the fact that this will actually operate in inclement weather.<br /><br />The documentation is practically non-existent, but I ran this light after fully charging it for over eight hours on its max setting and it was still operational. One feature that I especially like is this lantern can be charged with a standard micro USB cable via a vehicle, wall or even solar charger like the [[ASIN:B00KMRYSRM eBoot 5000mAh Solar Panel Charger with 2 USB Ports]]. The reason why I am making a big deal over something as mundane as a cable is many lanterns that I have tested use a barrel style connector, which is far less common and harder to replace if lost or damaged. The fact that this one uses the same cable that most android phone owners have makes it a convenience.<br /><br />Since the product specs cover the physical aspects I'll spare you a regurgitation. I will say that the light is very bright and suitable for reading at its highest setting, and the dual flashing modes are a safety feature for campers. The lantern will fit in the pockets of some of my work shirts, and takes up very little space in a hiking or camping pack.<br /><br />I've tested a large number of similar products, but this one stands out because of the standard charging cable and interface, compactness and durable design. It truly is suited for camping in just about any weather conditions, and stores enough power to last at least eight hours straight.",0.9712,336,37.333333333333336,0.1,2.32136
"I received this as a free review sample. I was on the fence about awarding it four or five stars, but since this is a sub ten buck light I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I'll address where it needs improvement first: lack of instructions. Mine came with no documentation, and normally that would not be a problem, but there appears to be a DC type barrel connector jack that leads me to conclude that this would accommodate rechargeable 18650 batteries, but no specs on any optional charger are provided. In fact, the port itself is a mystery.<br /><br />On the plus side this provides a lot of light for one- or two-person tents, and comes with both a bail and an S-hook for hanging. The light goes for an inner five LED night light, to a little more illumination provided by a second ring of LEDs, to full illumination for reading. The product description  claims that this light is sufficient for car repairs, and for some work that holds true. It actually illuminated my entire engine compartment in my SUV, but is not sufficiently focused for real detailed work.<br /><br />The ability to run this off three AAA (using the provided adapter) or a single 18650 makes it surprisingly versatile for such an inexpensive light. I tested it with an [[ASIN:B0154N4OBS EASTSHINE E35 3500mAh 3.7V 12.9Wh Protected 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery for High Drain Devices with EB182 Battery Organizer]][[ASIN:B0154N4OBS EASTSHINE E35 3500mAh 3.7V 12.9Wh Protected 18650 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery for High Drain Devices with EB182 Battery Organizer]] that was a tight fit, but worked perfectly. That particular battery is known to be slightly oversized, yet I was able to squeeze it into the battery compartment.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is an inexpensive, but functional lantern. It has decent illumination and is a nice choice for camping or as a general purpose light. Note that it is not waterproof, so cannot be hung and used exposed in inclement weather.",0.9847,397,33.083333333333336,0.0,2.29541
"I received this as a free review sample. I am going to address the reason I subtracted a star up front: the vessel is made from two pieces that are plastic 'welded' together. For normal use in controlled environments this is not an issue. However, I've owned bottles made from the same material and construction that literally split apart when dropped on concrete.<br /><br />The main reason why I still rated this so highly is while I own water bottles with this capacity this is the first infuser that is a full 32 ounces (that I know about.) Since my favorite way of hydrating is with infused apples, stick cinnamon and a touch of honey, this is perfect for me. I especially like the large infusing basket.<br /><br />While the product description claims you can use it with hot or old beverages take my word for it that although it will hold hot liquid, you do not want to use it for that. The main reason is it's difficult to handle. On the other hand, it can be run through a dishwasher (although you need to put the cap in the top tray.)<br /><br />Accessing the drinking spout requires that you release the stainless U-shaped bail, which locks the cap closed and helps to prevent leaks. Plus, this is totally leak-proof. I tried in vain to make it leak when I was testing it out and it is a tight seal.<br /><br />The side grips - one made from what looks like silicone and the opposite textured into the vessel - make handling this large bottle easy. Had another silicone piece been used in lieu of the textured pattern you probably could use this with hot liquids in a safe manner. This fit the console cup holders in my 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander, but is too tall to fit into the driver and passenger door cup holders (it's about 9.5 inches tall with the cap on.)<br /><br />Bottom line: if you work in a controlled environment (carpeted floors, etc.) and love to hydrate with infused drinks this is ideal. I would not recommend it for outdoors and harsh environments unless you are extra careful.",0.9671,437,27.3125,0.0,1.89013
"I received this as a free review sample. I was surprised by light weight and appreciate how compactly it folds and stores. Since the product description and photos provide all of the physical specs I'll spare you a recitation and will stick to personal observations.<br /><br />This bag is a lot roomier than I thought, and captures your body heat nicely. Where I am this time of year it rarely dips into the 40s, so I tested it at 55 degrees. It was plenty warm at that temperature, and it also breathed. Ironically, the less you are wearing (at 55 degrees) the warmer you feel after it has had a chance to capture and trap your own body heat.<br /><br />If you do intend to use it outdoors I recommend a waterproof ground cover or - better - an air mattress. The latter is best on open ground because this bag is thin and you will feel pebbles and even minor differences in ground level. Indoors it's totally comfortable and is perfect for guests. I personally intend to use it throughout the winter because we do get sub freezing temperatures a few times a year in Central Florida, and I prefer to conserve electricity during the cold months.<br /><br />You have a lot of 'wiggle' room in this bag, and as long as you note the limitations this is a bargain compared to some high end bags that I also own. No, this is not in the same league as those, but for the price this is still a good deal.<br /><br />Other factors are: it's sturdy and nicely constructed, light weight and less bulky than high end bags, and warm in temperate areas. The specs claim it will work as low as 14 degrees, but I think the recommended 40-50 is closer to the mark.",0.9751,363,33.0,0.0,2.29253
"I received this as a free review sample.  FrankiesReviews excellent November 1, 2015 review covers the physical characteristics in depth as well as providing a wealth of photos. I will try to avoid repeating that information and provide additional observations.<br /><br />First, I want to get a complaint about the specs and documentation out of the way. In essence, there are no real specifications that are revealed regarding the internal battery capacity, or the solar cell. Not knowing the battery capacity - expressed in milli Amps per hour (mAh) - provides no clue regarding how long the LEDs will operate, and the lack of information about the solar cell gives no idea how long it would take to fully charge the battery even if you did know its capacity.<br /><br />My complaints aside, this is both inexpensive and very effective. I was surprised by how well it illuminated a dark room when I tested it. I have not tested a run down rate, but the review I mentioned above claimed five hours and I will go with that.<br /><br />Do note that the only instructions are panels printed on the outside of the box. One claims that the external power is for 220 volts. I tested it in a 110-120 volt outlet and it worked, and the two pronged plug was clearly for US outlets. If you do plan to take advantage of the USB charging outlet to charge your phone, heed the warning that you should not use that feature while charging the internal battery from a wall outlet.<br /><br />This is definitely not water proof because the USB port and wall cable ports are exposed. However, for indoors use (or outdoors in good weather), this lantern is perfect. I love the copper color that actually makes for a rustic look on an enclosed porch or in a kitchen. The two bails transform it into an old-fashioned style lantern that can be hand carried or hung.<br /><br />I subtracted a star for the complaints I cited, but that does not detract from this lantern's usefulness. I actually love it, and if the lack of specs and other information is rectified it would easily be a five star product. It would be even better if the 110-120 volt charging input were replaced with USB input for charging from a vehicle or wall charger, and the exposed ports had water tight seals. I would love to see a redesigned lantern with those improvements, but in the meantime I do love it as is.",0.9952,493,30.8125,0.0,1.89856
"I received these as a free review sample. Others have covered the myriad of uses, so I will confine my review to some features that I like and other aspects that I tested.<br /><br />One of the nicest features is the fact that you can clip this on to a belt loop, shirt of even a helmet (using the short strips of velcro and some glue). As I was testing these I did notice that while the clip is convenient, it may be TOO convenient. It's so easy to attach to a piece of apparel that you may wind up clipping it to a pocket that obscures it if you are wearing a loose over shirt.  That is not a flaw in the design as much as my giving a head's up that how you use it is important.<br /><br />The light is not super bright (nor should it be since you do not want to distract drivers), so if you absolutely want to be seen the flash mode is perfect on dark, unlit streets and roads. Also, for biking or walking I recommend using both lights - one in the back and one in the front of your person - so that you can be seen from both directions.<br /><br />While the product specs do not claim this is waterproof I did submerge one of the lights in a sink of water for two  minutes and it remained operational. It may not be actually waterproof, but will not fail in inclement weather.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great way to remain safe on foot or bike, and the lights are nicely built.",0.9788,323,46.142857142857146,0.1,2.3236399999999997
"I received this as a free review sample and have been using it for seven months. It has held up wonderfully. Since there are ample reviews and product specs I will try to avoid repeating them and will stick to how I use it and why I like it so much.<br /><br />First, I subtracted a star because for outdoors use I personally believe this is sturdy enough. That said, it you do detail work that requires a strong light in a controlled environment this is perfect. The illumination at the highest setting is strong enough for me to inspect vintage fountain pens (under a magnifier) that I sometimes restore. It is also perfect for inspecting nooks and crannies (and that dreaded cabinet under my kitchen sink when I reorganize).<br /><br />Aside from the illumination, which is one of this light's strong points, is the comfort. I hate wearing headbands, but this one is comfortable to the point of being unobtrusive.<br /><br />Bottom line: for indoors use this is perfect. Outdoors, especially in harsh environments (and in heavy rain) this is not a light I would use.",0.95,231,28.875,0.0,1.885
"I received this set as a free review sample. What I like about them is they can be used as a temporary light set, since they are easily attached and removed from bikes. They will also augment existing lights, and especially of you have a front light, but are depending on a rear reflector to be seen at night.<br /><br />They are absolutely water resistant as claimed. I have owned mine for about six months and they are practically indestructible. Both the front and rear lights are sufficient to be easily seen in bad weather and at night. The front light is not the best path finder, so think of these as more of a safety light to be seen than as navigational lights in the dark.<br /><br />Mine are still running on the same sets of dollar store  batteries that I put in them five months ago, although I have not used these lights more than a few hours a month. When I have used them, though, it was usually in bad weather thanks to the daily storms we get in my part of the country during the summer months.<br /><br />Since they are removable you can quickly unlatch them from your bike and take them with you if you are worried about theft. They are small enough to literally fit in trouser pockets or in a purse - or backpack. Plus, given their sturdy construction, safety and reasonable cost they are truly a five star product.",0.8588,287,31.88888888888889,0.1,2.2876399999999997
"I received this as a free review sample. When it arrived it was a lot smaller than I expected (2.6 x 1.8 x approximately 5 inches). However, when I inserted the required AA batteries and hit the power button I was very surprised by the amount of illumination it puts out. Even a brightly lit room this adds even more light. Do note that the AA batteries are not included.<br /><br />One of the reasons this works so well is the reflector that makes maximum use of the light put out by the LED arrangement. I did test it at night as well and it worked perfectly on my enclosed patio. I could actually read by it in an otherwise dark room. If there is a shortcoming, it's the actual level of brightness. You can ruin your night vision by looking directly into it. It's best used as an overhead. Plus since the part that houses the reflector and LED is clear all around, it's not directional and can affect night vision of anyone on a space like a camping tent unless you take care in where you hang or place it.<br /><br />I am not sure how waterproof this lantern is. The battery compartment is in the bottom and there appears to be no seal to keep out any water (and I did not test it). Hanging or off the floor it should not be a problem, but if you are looking for an emergency light that must withstand the elements this is probably not what you want. If you intend to use it as depicted - an overhead in a tent or hanging camping lantern - this is a handy light source. For me I have mine in a drawer for occasional in home use for then we lose power (a too common event in central Florida). It's small enough to stay out of the way, but functional enough to provide a nice amount of light when needed.",0.8788,375,23.4375,0.4,2.38364
"I received this as a free review sample. I have been infusing for years, so when infusers started to hit the market I eagerly accepted a number of them since in the past you had to craft your own solutions.<br /><br />This one is basic in both features and price, but is absolutely leak and has a big infusion basket. The latter is one of the reasons why I rated this so highly because many otherwise excellent infusers have small baskets that require overnight infusing, This one can infuse in a few hours or even on the fly if you are using thinly sliced ingredients or smaller ones that have been halved.<br /><br />Another feature that I like is simplicity. Unlike some of the more advanced infusers this one is easy to assemble and break down. No multi-stage infusing chambers or other complicated assemblies. Plus the construction is excellent. The main chamber  is one piece, The cheaper models that I have come across are two pieces 'welded' together that will split in half if dropped (been there; done that.)<br /><br />If there is a single thing I do not personally like it's the mouth that is a little too wide and can spill to the sides when you are drinking from it. That is not a show stopper, and you may not find it to be an issue, but I feel compelled to mention it.",0.9523,276,30.666666666666668,0.0,2.2856899999999998
"I received this as a free review sample. Since there are some detailed reviews that cover the physical aspects of this portable shower (which it really is), I will keep my review brief and provide some observations.<br /><br />First, the capacity is easily sufficient for two people if you conserve water. That means wetting, lathering and rinsing. If you have ever served in the navy aboard ship you know the drill. It is effective and easily conserves water.<br /><br />Since I did not have an opportunity to test this in the field I tried it out in my shower stall, hanging it from the shower head. Water flow is pretty light, although it will effectively support the wet/lather/rinse cycle I cited above. Just do not expect high pressure or a lot of volume. You may have to use it a few times to become completely accustomed to it, but in my opinion it's worth it because it is truly portable and once you get the hang of it you will appreciate it. Especially the miserly use of just five gallons of water. You will also be surprised by just how little water you require to effectively shower. I mentioned that this sufficient for two people. Properly used it a full bag will work for three people! That takes time and practice, but can be achieved.<br /><br />Other features I like are the temperature gauge, large filling spout, and the fact that this will allow a hot (or at least a very warm) shower.",0.9818,301,23.153846153846157,0.0,2.29454
"I received this as a free review sample. I am not going to repeat the product specs on this page since the material and unfolded dimensions are provided by the manufacturer. I will give my take on this and reasons why I rated it so highly.<br /><br />What I especially like is the compact size that it folds to. Out of the box it's only 12.5x4x1 inches, which will fit in a backpack or even in the glove box of most vehicles (especially if you fold it over lengthwise.)<br /><br />There is a slight chemical odor as soon as you unbox it, so I recommend airing it out before refolding and storing it for actual use. It takes about an hour for the odor to dissipate.<br /><br />Using it is as simple as placing your valuables inside, folding over the reinforced rib at the top (the mouth) of the bag two or three times, then doubling and using the closure snaps. You are NOT supposed to press the air out because that will provide buoyancy in the event that it falls into water. I am not sure how much weight it will take to achieve negative buoyancy, but partially filled with air it will support a good five pounds and still maintain a degree of positive buoyancy. The key point and why I rated this so highly is I tested it with a towel and a brick and it kept the towel completely dry.<br /><br />If you camp, boat or spend time at the beach and want to safeguard wallets, phones and tablets, this bag will do the trick.",0.9689,319,35.44444444444444,0.2,2.35067
"I received this as a review sample and was quite honestly surprised by how cleverly it's designed. More about that below. The main issue I have and why I subtracted a star is it's a little on the narrow side. Otherwise, it's perfect. And for me that includes the relative thinness because I tested it outside on my lawn and it was actually comfortable. Or as comfortable as it can be since laying on it is akin to walking a tightrope because of its narrowness.<br /><br />When I claim it's cleverly designed I am not exaggerating. It self inflates by opening a valve. For me between the material and the inflation it was sufficiently thick to be comfortable on my lawn. Obviously it will require relatively level and soft (or at least rock free) ground. I closed the valve after it inflated and when I was ready to roll it up all I had to do was open the valve and tightly roll it.<br /><br />The rolling up part was where I expected a struggle, but that was smooth. It does not roll back up as tightly as it's rolled when you first receive it, but there is still ample room to place it in the included carrying bag.<br /><br />If I have one recommendation for improvement (aside from making it wider) it would be to use velro straps attached to the air pad instead of the elastic 'garters' that come with it. The 'garters' work fine, but can be easily misplaced. Otherwise, for me this is perfect.",0.9829,308,23.692307692307693,0.0,1.89487
"I received this as a review sample and to be honest do not have any recent experience with air mattresses other than this one. That said, I did use it in my home for a solid week, both with the companion [[ASIN:B00U2VI1A8 Lightspeed Outdoors Foam Topper for Air Mattresses]] and without it. If that sounds odd, it's been a long time since I have slept in my bed. Long story, but I can attest that this is infinitely superior to the sofa on which I normally sleep.<br /><br />Initially I slept on it for two days without the topper and it was absolutely comfortable. Part of that is I was able to stretch out more than I normally do because of the size. With the topper this is an entirely different piece of bedding. It's vastly more comfortable, but also introduces cleaning challenges. I would say that for occasional guests or short camping the topper merits consideration. For longer term use I am not so sure because the topper needs to be professionally cleaned periodically.<br /><br />The included pump makes this a snap to fill. Note that you will need to supply four D batteries (I would have preferred eight of the more common AA ones, but that is a personal preference.) Deflating it was relatively easy, and it rolls and stores a lot easier than the topper that is made by the same company. In fact, this is lighter (to me, anyway) and less bulky than the topper, and takes up very little space in my home. It can easily store in the bottom drawer of my chest of drawers, or on a linen closet shelf. For camping this does not add a lot of weight when carrying it and a pack, which is another plus in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, this is far more comfortable than I remember old style air mattresses to be, and a lot easier to inflate, deflate and pack.",0.9899,387,27.642857142857142,0.0,2.29697
"I received this as a review sample along with the base air mattress ([[ASIN:B00IHX26X6 Lightspeed Outdoors 2-Person PVC-Free Air Bed with Battery Operated Pump]]). The product description provides all of the dimensions and the previous reviews are also detailed, so I will avoid repeating those - especially the product description.<br /><br />This is offered as a general purpose topper that will fit a variety of brands. I tested it on the air mattress, but also on my bed. It securely affixes to the air mattress, but not my bed. I expected the way it fit the bed because it is not designed for those. In both cases, though, it is comfortable. In fact, the air mattress without it was ... just an air mattress, but with this topper is as comfortable as any bed in which I've slept.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, getting it into the included bag is a chore, but it is relatively light and compact for folks who camp. For those of us who are going to use this in the home with an air mattress for guests, it will store easily in most linen closets, as well as in some deeper drawers (the bottom drawer in my chest of drawers holds it.<br /><br />I did not see any cleaning instructions, but given the size it probably will need to be professionally cleaned (and eventually it will). It will definitely not fit in my large size washer.<br /><br />Overall, if you have never used one of these toppers you probably will not see the need. However, I will forewarn, though, that once you do use it, you will not like your air mattress without it.",0.9649,346,34.6,0.1,2.31947
"I received a pair of these as review samples. While they are perfect for their intended use - keeping mud off your jeans while mucking about in swampy and muddy places, they are also excellent for protection against some snake bites. To be sure, they are not going to work as your sole protection, but they do provide an additional layer that will protect your ankles from fangs.<br /><br />The key is they are loose and billow around your ankles. When worn over flared and thick trousers and snake proof boots you have protection in depth in that area.<br /><br />Of course, they are also excellent for reducing mud as you hike (or even do yard work after a heavy rain.) The velcro makes these easy to put on and remove, and will not jam or break like zippers or come loose like buttons and cord.<br /><br />Bottom line: they are perfect for hiking in snake country as well as keeping mud to a minimum.",0.9754,199,39.8,0.6,2.47262
"I received this as a review sample and want to disclose up front that the actual light is a small unit measuring approximately 1.5x2.25 inches. As small is it is the amount of illumination is incredible.<br /><br />Since the product specs and some of the previous reviews cover this in great detail I will try to fill in the cracks and provide [hopefully] useful information that others missed.<br /><br />First, the 'O' rings mentioned are not for sealing, but affixing the light to handlebars and the headband that ships with this light. The velcro strap is for the battery pack. I think the design of the 'O' rings in particular is clever, but do be aware that they are easy to lose and if you drop one on a dark surface in the rain it will be hard to find even using the strong illumination from this light. I know this because it actually happened.<br /><br />The light runs a little hot, but the fins, which are heat sinks, prevent it from burning you. I recommend waiting a few minutes after turning it off before removing it from the hear band or handlebars.<br /><br />I cannot validate the waterproof claim since there is no IP rating given at the time of this review. It will certainly work in the rain and other wet environments, but as for submerging the unit and the depth to which it can remain waterproof I have no idea. The battery pack connector looks waterproof and certainly worked in a heavy rain, and the light itself is thoroughly sealed.<br /><br />If there is one lament it's the lack of instructions. For example, the 'O' ring and velcro strap took a few minutes to figure out. However, that is not a show stopper and this is not an overly complex piece of gear.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is portable enough to fit in a shirt pocket (the light unit anyway - the battery pack will not), and throws an incredible amount if illumination. The main value is it can be used as a bike light as well as on the headband for a variety of uses.",0.937,436,39.63636363636363,0.5,2.4311
"I received this bag/pack as a review sample. The only thing that needs improvement is hard copy instructions should be included.<br /><br />As it is, the instructions that are in the product images (at the time of this review) are invaluable and will save a great deal of frustration. Specifically, if you look at steps 5 and 6 in that instruction photo you will see advice for using a hair dryer to expand the seal when you are trying to separate the edges for the first time.<br /><br />Since others have exhaustively described the physical characteristics and potential uses, I will stick with personal observations and a few notes that are easy to miss from the instructions. First, this pouch works as advertised. Second, it has a depth limitation - two meters - after which it is not guaranteed to be waterproof. If you plan to use this when diving heed that because if you go below the two meter limit you risk getting the contents of the pouch wet.<br /><br />For me this is perfect for harsh or wet environments and I doubt if I would ever need to use this to the limits I mentioned above. It' s also perfect for prepositioning emergency gear in a bugout or emergency kit. Note the product dimensions in the product description on this page to ensure that your personal belongings or emergency gear will fit.

"I received this as a review sample and have been using it for a little over a week. Prior to receiving this one I had been using a pair of compression rings, so my exercise regimen was already established.<br /><br />This has pros and cons over the simpler rings. On the pro side I can adjust the resistance of the grip, allowing me to progressively work my way from easier to harder exercises. On the con side a pair of these is a lot more expensive than the rings that I had been using.<br /><br />After a week of using this on the minimum resistance setting (where I intend to keep it) the transition from the rings I was using to this was seamless. My normal exercises continued with no real changes to the routine, and this grip is not as easy to misplace as the rings.<br /><br />Since I had been doing hand strength exercises for quite some time before using this device I can speak to the long term benefits of those (using any device). The strength such exercises develop and the working of muscles and joints are a hedge against the aging process because at sixty-six I was starting to feel the effects of age. Since my 'day job' is professional drummer my hands are important and this - and, to be fair, the rings I was using - keep my hands in shape. More importantly, they build strength and stamina.<br /><br />Bottom line: this grip works, is well made, and can truly make a difference if you consistently use it.",0.9729,314,39.25,0.0,2.29187
"I have been using the review sample that I received for about six weeks. I took my time because some reviews cited the mount as a weak link as well as disputing whether or not this is the 'brightest'. I will admit that the mount seems flimsy, but in six weeks of relatively hard use it has held up.<br /><br />As for brightness, I cannot say that it is or isn't the brightest. I will say that it illuminates a narrow path in front of you and definitely is oncoming driver friendly.<br /><br />One thing about the mount is it will snap the light in place and firmly hold it if you follow the instruction sheet. It also quick releases the light so it will not get stolen when you chain your bike and go shopping or whatever. Plus it, like the tail light, installs without tools. I love that feature. I also love the fact that this light charges using a standard USB cable and not some proprietary one with a barrel connector. That is one of the reasons why I awarded this five stars.<br /><br />Since the product specs cover the use and charging times in depth, I will not recite them here. I will say that I run mine at 100% brightness all the time and the 1.5 hour use time is fairly accurate.<br /><br />There may be better lights on the market, but not at this one's price. I am thoroughly pleased with it and happy that I gave it six weeks before rushing to review it. In my opinion there is nothing seriously wrong with it and a lot that is right.",0.9858,328,27.33333333333333,4.3,3.5857399999999995
"I received one of these as a review sample and have been using it for about a month. Since there are a lot of reviews that already describe this in detail I will stick to a few observations and why I awarded this five stars.<br /><br />First, some reviewers complained about a chemical odor coming from the sleeve. Mine had a slight odor when I unboxed it, but it was not particularly strong. I got rid of it by immersing the sleeve in the same hot, soapy dish water that I initially used to clean the bottle itself. After rinsing with clear water and air drying the odor practically disappeared (although if you stick your nose on it and sniff there is a very slight remaining odor.)<br /><br />You can use this for hot or cold liquids because the borosilicate glass is identical to Corning's Pyrex. There are some caveats for hot liquids, though. First, while the silicone seals are impervious to heat, the metal cap will pick up some of the hear via an exposed metal piece in the cap assembly that will come into contact with hot liquid when the bottle is full. When it does it can get a little warm. Not sufficient to burn you, but there is some risk of discomfort. As long as you are aware of it, then there should be no problems.<br /><br />I awarded this five stars based on the fact that it can accommodate cold and hot liquids, and the sleeve is an excellent insulator. It will keep hot things hot and cold things cold, but it also protects the bottle against chipping. I am not sure if it would protect against a drop, but would not be surprised if it did indoors on a carpeted surface. On the other hand I would be surprised it it protected against a drop on a hard or rocky surface, so this bottle is best suited for in-vehicle and home/office environments. I would not recommend it for harsher environments.",0.8743,387,25.8,0.1,2.29229
"This bottle is a perfect companion for me when I am performing on stage, and especially in hot venues. It's also ideal for the activities I put in the title. Note: I received this as a review sample.<br /><br />Here are some observations. First, while this can hold hot liquids thanks to the silicone sealing ring in the cap, I recommend against it. I tested this with hot coffee and two things happened. First, it was too hot to hold for about ten minutes, and second, it rapidly cooled due to the thin walls and the large surface area that promotes heat transfer.<br /><br />Because this is thin-walled it will not keep liquids cold for long either, One workaround is to fill it a quarter the way with ice, then your beverage or water. It will maintain coolness for about 90 minutes unless you are in a truly hot place. It will also sweat, so take that into account.<br /><br />The reason why I think it's perfect is capacity. That, coupled with a surprisingly indestructible exterior (I would have never guessed that such a thin vessel would take the knocks it does without denting), and leak proof cap make it ideal for outdoors activities.<br /><br />There is one characteristic that some folks will find useful: this is made from the non-magnetic variety of stainless steel. If you are in an environment or performing an activity where non-magnetic objects are required, this one will be acceptable.<br /><br />For me the lack of thermal qualities is not a detriment because I use it mainly for rehydrating and I prefer to drink water at room temperature.<br /><br />A final note: this is a hand wash only bottle that is NOT dishwasher safe. Also, if you are using it for citrus-based drinks the interior may discolor. Other that those, this is the perfect bottle for me.",0.987,387,32.25,0.2,2.3561
"This pack is small enough to attach to a belt loop or store in a glove compartment. Even after my clumsy job of repacking it into the self-contained and integrated case it measured about 6x6x3 inches and is feather light.<br /><br />Note that while the product photos (at the time of this review) look as though you are getting a backpack and a smaller case, you are only getting a single item. The smaller case shown is integrated into this pack and functions as the storage when not in use. Since the product description and other reviews have exhaustively covered the physical characteristics I will highlight my experience.<br /><br />First, there are no real instructions, and when you first figure out how to unpack it you marvel at the full size. Then panic sets in because you cannot believe that you can repack it. Actually, both procedures are fairly intuitive. I had mine unfurled in mere minutes, and when it came time to repack I stretched the entire pack out, folded it over laterally, then continued folding it lengthwise until it fit into the zippered pouch that is part of the pack. Even I was able to accomplish that on the first attempt, and when you've done it a few times it literally takes less than a minute.<br /><br />Second, it's surprisingly comfortable with the shoulder straps and fit. As others have mentioned it's not for heavy loads (although you can easily manage about twelve pounds without damaging or straining it. The zippers are decent quality and the compartment holds more than I would have guessed. I was about to cram a beach towel, a small bluetooth speaker and a water bottle in the pack with room for other odds and ends.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great pack for those times when you wish you had one (like at a swap meet or farmer's market), and a grab-and-go for active folks. Even though the design implies occasional use, it can be an everyday pack as long as your loads are relatively light.",0.9806,406,33.833333333333336,0.3,2.3841799999999997
"This is a relatively easy light to figure out, which is a good thing because my review sample came with no instructions. Since two previous reviews have raved about it, I will give a few impressions and the reasons why I rated it five stars despite the lack of documentation.<br /><br />First, it's super bright, even on the lowest power stetting. As you cycle through the higher power settings the illumination practically doubles in intensity and angle. Or at least that is the illusion.<br /><br />A feature that I particularly like is the green indicator light set that faces you if you do mount it on a bike. That shows you at a glance where the power button is. I would have preferred red since that part of the spectrum enhances night vision, but the green is not glaring.<br /><br />This set comes with both a concave mount and velcro for handle bar mounting, as well as a head band to affix the light to. That widens the number of potential uses for this light.<br /><br />Physically it's pretty small, measuring a little over 2.5 inches wide by 1.5 inches tall. For the amount of illumination it casts that is an impressive ratio,<br /><br />One final note: one reviewer mentioned that this ran hot. My unit did not. It got a little warm after fifteen minutes, but I was still able to comfortable hold it in my hands. My five star rating is based on performance, compact size and the versatility of this light.",0.9786,313,28.454545454545453,0.1,2.3235799999999998
"I do not engage in strenuous exercise, but having had a heart attack I do like to monitor my heart rate when I am doing light exercises to keep in shape. For that reason I accepted one of these as a review sample and waited until I had ample time to evaluate it before posting a review.<br /><br />At the risk of repeating the product specs or the other reviewers my impression is this is reasonably complete for anyone who wants to monitor fitness. There is a slight learning curve, but the instructions are clearly written. You do need to use this in conjunction with the chest belt that is included. That part is adjustable and easy to clean.<br /><br />Aside from the ease of use and a fairly complete suite of metrics, the display is very easy to read. For me that is one of the most important features because my sixty-five year old eyes are not what they once were.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a complete fitness and health monitoring solution for most folks. It's sturdy and unobtrusive (although the watch is somewhat large.)",0.9901,222,31.714285714285715,2.0,2.89703
"As I write this review the sample that I received is magnetically attached to my refrigerator to serve as a late night kitchen light. I am not going to repeat the product specs, but at the time of this review the dimensions are not provided. Since this is a relatively large light I think that including the is important.<br /><br />The light is 8 inches long, of which 6.5 inches are unobstructed for displaying the light itself. The width is approximately 1.25 inches. Note also that the shape of this light is hexagonal, and three of the eight sides are part of the illuminating system. That means that this can be used directionally without blinding you in the process. If that sounds silly, I own a round LED light that is 360 degrees of illumination and it can be a chore to use in the dark of night. I have wrecked my night vision with that one more than once, but the design of this one prevents that.<br /><br />The product specs claim that the four steady settings range from two percent to one hundred percent of the 200 lumens. I personally think the two percent figure is off because even at that low setting this light will illuminate up to a meter (or even more) in front of you, and at full setting it will easily illuminate detail at five meters. I like the flashing setting too because this can be used as an emergency beacon as well as in home lighting.<br /><br />I have not tested this for a rundown, nor have I tested the recharging time. I did use it for two straight hours on full setting and it only slightly dimmed. If you combine it with a 2000mAh backup battery it makes a great emergency light.<br /><br />One final note: the magnets in the body are pretty strong. I tried knocking mine off my refrigerator door by purposely bumping into it and it budged, but held fast. I like this one so much that I am ordering a few more. The reason is I prefer rechargeable lights to replaceable battery ones. Plus, if I do need to check something in the yard at night (or make an emergency egress) this light is handily located on my fridge door. A few more would increase both safety and convenience.",0.9805,450,26.47058823529412,0.3,2.38415
"I have been infusing waters for a few years now, In the past year a number of infusing systems like this one have appeared so I am freed from the makeshift ones I used in the past. I received this one as a review sample and have more that a few others to which I can compare it.<br /><br />The first thing I like is the capacity. It holds an ample 23 ounces of liquids and ingredients. That provides a lot of hydration when out and about. I do wish the infusing basket were a little longer to expose more of the infusing ingredients to the water, but for all practical purposes the one in this system is adequate.<br /><br />The reason why I mentioned in the title that this one is perfect for beginners is it's easy to disassemble, is well sealed and leak proof, and easy to clean. I own some of the first generation infusers that are complicated and some are even made of glass. To be sure, those are perfect for we experienced infusers, but can be daunting to someone who is exploring the benefits. If you are new I recommend grabbing a copy of this excellent book: [[ASIN:B00IZ05F52 Fruit Infused Water - 80 Vitamin Water Recipes for Weight Loss, Health and Detox Cleanse)]]. It;s short, but packed with some good recipes that will get you started. Note: this bottle comes with an offer for a free ebook as well, I did not sign up for it because I have a personal policy of never joining a list in exchange for free information. You may want to check it out if you do order one of these.<br /><br />Other reasons why I love this bottle is it's tough. It may be plastic, but I dropped mine and it did not crack. It's also BPA-free, which is a big deal for me. Finally, it's easy to hand wash.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want to explore the benefits of infusing waters this bottle is a nice, entry level system, Even if you are an experienced infuser this is worth looking into, Although the basket is too short in my opinion, the diameter is sufficient for mixing and matching ingredients. Plus I love having more than one bottle so I can grab one for short trips and to keep myself refreshed on breaks when performing.",0.9982,472,31.466666666666665,0.1,2.3294599999999996
"I had no idea that an 80/20 poly to nylon blend could be so absorbent. This 'towel' works out of the shower, and is light and compact enough at less than five and a half ounces and folded to a scant 7x5 inches to be negligible in a backpack. I am currently carrying mine with me in a gig bag for hot, sweaty performances.<br /><br />There are a few things that I truly like. One is the zipper pattern stitching around the entire towel. That seam reinforces the towel. The other is mine has already gone through two wash cycles without any issues. I had initial concerns about durability due to the thinness of this towel, but those have been assuaged. It holds up in actual use.<br /><br />What I love most, though, is how soft this is. The hanging hook is a nice feature, but frankly I do not use it. And the bleed free feature is moot since the towel I have is gray. I toss it in with colors and have not noticed any issue there. It has not faded one iota, so I am guessing that the no-bleed claim is valid.<br /><br />Basically, this is best for folks who camp or want a compact and lightweight towel that actually absorbs. For home I use a regular towel because weight and size are not issues. For my gig bag this is perfect.",0.9839,279,19.928571428571427,0.1,2.32517
"This is the smaller version of the second generation bottle. More about that in a minute. The reasons why I love this are the smaller size that fits in the beverage holder in my vehicle, and the improvements that were made when the second generation was released.<br /><br />Improvements include the double wall construction that not only keeps this one (and the [[ASIN:B00LFPS0CY Hydracentials Sporty 25 Oz]] sibling) from sweating, but provides the insulation to keep drinks colder longer.<br /><br />I can attest that the eight hour claim is absolutely true. To be sure it does not keep it ice cold that long, but it sure keeps it cold. I left mine in my car - with the insulation sock that shipped with mine - and it was cold hours later. This was in 95 degree weather,  which would have turned a regular bottle of water hot. I am serious about that/ I did not test this without the additional insulating sock, but I am guessing that the water would have not gotten any warmer than cool without it.<br /><br />Mine also came with a pair of straw cleaning brushes. I have not used those yet because I have found that soaking the top, straw and bottle in hot, soapy water, rinsing with a jet of clear water and air drying work perfectly.<br /><br />Do note that this is NOT for hot liquids. It was not designed for them, and a hot liquid would probably ruin both the straw and the swivel piece to which it connects.<br /><br />For me this is the ideal size, but click on the link to the 25 ounce model if you like your water supersized. Either way I think you'll be happy with one of these models because they are an improvement over others on the market that I have used, including this brand's original bottle.",0.9858,378,37.8,0.0,2.29574
"Daniel G. Lebryk's September 12, 2014 review mirrors my own experience, although it's clear that he knows a lot more about tent pitching than I. When I received my review sample I approached this the same way I did with my B00B5V7B1O. I quickly learned that they are two very different types of shade, with totally different approaches to setting up.<br /><br />It provides a 9 feet wide by 4.5 feet high by 4 feet deep shelter when set up.<br /><br />This one has a learning curve, but the trade off is you are getting a very portable shade that is not only for beaches. This is the perfect shelter for hikers who want basic protection from the elements. One thing that I discovered is if you attempt to set this up without regard to prevailing wind (or even breeze) you could be chasing it. It's a big sail and it does not take much to catch it and lift it if you do not heed Lebryk's advice regarding angling the stakes when you secure it to the ground.<br /><br />While it is not waterproof, it will keep you from getting drenched in the event it a fast rising storm. Again, this is of greater value to hikers, especially due to the light weight when this is in its carry bag.<br /><br />For me the compactness is the biggest feature. After setting it up a few times you will level the learning curve. Folding and storing it properly will take a bit longer.<br /><br />Now that I am accustomed to using this it is now part of my emergency 'bug out' kit - a collection of small, essential items that I can manage if I need to leave the area in a hurry. Since my locale can (and does) get hit with some scary weather from time to time, this one goes with me if I have to evacuate.<br /><br />Whatever the reason you are considering this, I can assure you that if you take the limitations into account this is a bargain and very useful for a number of scenarios. Including the one for which it was designed: a portable cabana.",0.9516,435,39.54545454545455,0.3,2.37548
"I received this as a review sample, but have considerable experience with an identical one I got back in March of this year. I gave the first one to my band leader who loves it and has taken it to every gig. However, there are important factors you need to know before purchasing this model.<br /><br />First, this is strictly for cold beverages. Hot liquids - or even running through a dishwasher - will ruin it.  Second, it has zero insulation, so it's going to sweat if you put ice cold liquid in it on a hot day, and it isn't going to keep it cold for much over an hour.<br /><br />A few notes: this is leak proof. I've tossed this one, full, into my gig bag and not a drop has spilled. The same with the one I gave my band leader. You do need to make sure that the folding nozzle is completely in the down position, though, because if it's even slightly raised this bottle will leak. As for drinking from it, you need to ensure two things: (1) the 'stray' is inserted with the end that has a forty-five degree cut facing the bottom instead of being inserted into the hole in the lid, and (2) the nozzle has to be straight up. Even the slightest rotation from that position will inhibit the flow.<br /><br />The bottle is anodized aluminum, so there is no paint to peel. You absolutely need to hand wash it though.<br /><br />Why I gave this five stars: first, this is a fraction of price of the first one I got. Second, this ships with a spare silicone seal for the lid, and third, it works performs like any stainless steel water bottle will. Finally, it's convenient. It has a nice carry handle built into the lid that can be attached to my belt loop with a D-Ring when I am walking and hiking, or to my hi-hat stand when I am performing. Either way, it's a ready source of water with which to stay hydrated.<br /><br />Bottom line: Liquids will not stay cold for long, but I personally prefer water at room temperature. On hot days when I am driving to a gig I will throw this in my hardware bag with an ice cube or two to keep my water from getting hot, but otherwise it's perfect for me. Plus, based on how well the one I got in March has held up for my band leader I expect this to take the same abuse and serve me just as well.",0.943,523,30.764705882352946,0.0,2.2829
"I've tried a few other styles of infuser and have fallen love with the review sample of this one that I recently received. To be honest I love the other models that I have used too. Some are more complicated than others, but all have proven to be effective and efficient at infusing waters.<br /><br />Here are the main reasons why I prefer this one. First, it's reasonably light compared to two other brands that I own. This is made of a light weight plastic that is BPA-free, and seems resilient to dropping (which I managed to do.) One of my other ones is glass, which is both heavy and fragile, and the other plastic one I own is heavier and lacks the carrying strap.<br /><br />A second reason why I love this is the infusing basket is simple, deep and easy to remove. It does not have the juicing section that other infusers have, but since I usually infuse with lime or lemon quarters and eighths, it does not need one. More importantly, the basket has a bail that makes it easy to remove. Plus there are no complicated o-rings or seals and this one has never leaked.<br /><br />Still another reason is the cap has a positive locking mechanism that keeps it sealed when you are not drinking from it. And the 'icing on the cake' is the drinking spout is large, but not so large that my fruits come out. Of course, you will probably have to adjust the way you cut fruits or vegetables if you are accustomed to finer pieces because the spout it not tiny.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a no-frills infuser that may lack some of the features of other brands, but it's also less complex. I love the fact that it's grab and go. Plus the large infuser seems to do a better job of marrying flavors with your water. If you want a real treat try Acqua Panna Natural Spring Water as the base for your infused drinks.",0.9933,400,28.571428571428573,0.0,2.29799
"Although I am not inactive, I do not perform many structured exercises except for a daily regimen of isometrics and some light calisthenics. When I was offered a review sample of these I was intrigued.<br /><br />They are effective and my sore muscles are evidence of that. After going through three repetitions of the exercises in the included poster I am feeling the results of heretofore unexercised muscles that I did not know existed. My repetitions started with the light band and worked through the medium and heavy ones, going completely through the exercises with each band before moving to the next one.<br /><br />Obviously I have not had these long enough (at the time of this review) to make claims about toning and other benefits. Time will tell on those and if the results are better than I expect I'll update this review accordingly.<br /><br />Besides the ease of adding these to my exercise regime, I love these because of the ease of storing. They fit in a 3.5 x 5.75 inch pouch (included) and will fit in my jeans pocket. That means I can take these with me when I am hiking or at the beach.<br /><br />Finally, the reason for five stars (in addition to what I cited above) is these are actually fun. Plus the exercises are a perfect starter for anyone who wants to start an exercise regimen, but wants to ramp up slowly.",0.9246,287,35.875,0.2,2.33738
"When I received this as a review sample I was surprised by how compact it was - it was folded in a bag that measured less than 12 inches by 10 inches and a little over an inch thick. It's definitely compact and easy to store.<br /><br />The design is clever, but I am going to avoid repeating the product description or Comdet's detailed July 26, 2014 review. I actually took this to a stretch of beach in Daytona Beach Shores to test it out. The sand is fairly hard packed so the metal stakes were sufficient. If you intend to use this on a beach that is sandier you may want to use different stakes that will stay in the ground. The loops on the corners will fit just about any stake you can buy. Of course, if you want to increase your load, four paving stones, which fit into the sand pockets - plus the stakes - will probably keep this in place regardless of the breeze. That is the main issue with this or any other beach blanket because a little wind under this 7x6 foot blanket turns it into a large sail.<br /><br />I love the material for keeping sand off things. It's thin, super thin,in fact, so it's more of a sand barrier that you can lay on as long as you find a comfortable spot on the beach. Note that this is purposely not waterproof, so it cannot be used as a tarp in a rain. On the other hand, it will dry very quickly and it your beach spot has a wash station you can rinse this to remove all sand, and it will dry in literally minutes.<br /><br />Now that I have tested it for what it was designed to do my use is as a dust cover for my drum kit. I have two set up in my studio and they collect dust (even if I play them every day), so this will be going over the one I use least. The cool thing is this 'blanket' will function for a number of purposes between visits to the beach. It's light, can be secured to corners and will even block the sun on that south side window. Let your imagination run amok.",0.9903,440,29.33333333333333,0.2,2.35709
"Since other reviewers have so helpfully described this pack in detail I will provide my reasons for awarding it five stars. I received mine as a review sample and want to disclose that up front.<br /><br />I love hiking and where I live there are parks throughout the area. Hydration is essential and especially during the summer months. In the past I either cut my hikes short or brought bulky bottles along. This pack changed that. It's unobtrusive, easy to carry and holds enough water to allow me to wander off the beaten path without worrying about my return distance. While the product description claims two hours, I can get twice that out of the water bag because I consume it sparingly and hiking is not as rigorous as cycling or other activities. There is a slight aftertaste to the water when you first start using this pack, but it goes away (that, or I am now so accustomed to it that I don't notice it.)<br /><br />Because mine has a nice red reflective finish I recommended it to a friend who cycles. That safety feature is not relevant to my use, but is critical for folks who are on the road.<br /><br />The pockets and other features are icing on the cake for me, but frankly I rarely use them. For me this is a hydration pack that is comfortable to carry and light weight. It's also a lot more convenient than lugging a few quart size plastic bottles along on the hike.<br /><br />Bottom line: this pack has some great features and is not only a convenient way to stay hydrated, but promotes safety as well.",0.9904,331,27.58333333333333,0.3,2.38712
"I received this set as a review sample and was impressed with not only the design, but the construction.<br /><br />DESIGN: this is made to not only install with no tools, but to also be water- and dust-proof. Apparently the engineers know a thing or two about riding bicycles in all kinds of terrain. The nicest feature in my opinion is this set is portable. You can easily switch it from one bike to another by unhooking it. Of course, that makes it a target for theft so this is best removed when you have your bike parked in populated or uncontrolled areas.<br /><br />The fast and slow flash modes, and the steady light are switchable by depressing the lens for each mode, plus off. The two flashing modes work on both the white and red lights, and the fast flash has a strobe effect that makes for excellent safety. That, plus the two hundred forty degree illumination make bikes highly visible at night.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION: The lens and battery compartment is isolated against water and dust by an O-ring. The band which you hook around handle bars or seat posts is made of silicon and is practically indestructible. It will adjust to very small diameters (in fact I have it on a microphone stand at the moment.)<br /><br />Bottom line: this is one of the safest products a bike rider can own. If you own more than one bike it can quickly and easily moved from one to another, so you need only invest in a single set.",0.9729,311,28.272727272727277,0.0,2.29187
"A few notes up front to save you time: (1)this is not for hot beverages. If you are looking for a vessel for coffee on your morning commute this is not it. (2) it's mainly stainless steel with zero insulation, so it will not keep beverages cold for any longer than if they were in any other bottle or cup.<br /><br />I received one of these as a review sample. It's perfect for staying hydrated when I am on stage. For one thing at twenty-five ounces it has ample capacity to get through the forty-five minute sets. For another it's a lot more aesthetic than a plastic bottle. When performing small things like the look of a water bottle can actually affect audience perception.<br /><br />However, most folks will probably use this for outdoors activities or in their vehicles. For outdoors this is perfect. It's sturdy and leak proof (I tried in vain to shake out a few drops to see how tight the seal is - it's tight!) I also love the form factor, which is tall and slim. It will fit just about anyone's hand, and even has small indents to allow a firmer grip if the outside is wet.<br /><br />Another feature I love is the top, which has a cool loop that you can use with a D-ring to hang this from handlebars or even a belt loop (or, in my case, the lug on a drum since that is the instrument I play on stage). The fold-down straw will not leak, and it a convenient spout for taking quick swigs of water or other liquid.<br /><br />This is NOT a bottle that you can pop in the dishwasher. The instructions are clear that a dishwasher can damage this bottle. I am guessing that the parts at risk are the internal straw and the fold-down straw spout integrated into the top. The internal straw is detachable. In fact if something were to happen to it a 'milkshake' style straw with a .25 inch diameter is a perfect replacement. If you want to really get fancy you can replace the plastic one that comes with this with a [[ASIN:B00HI4L4G0 Epica Stainless Steel Drinking Straw]].<br /><br />Bottom line: for me the sturdiness is a major plus because I can pop this in a gig bag and not worry about it breaking or leaking. I love the form factor, and especially love the capacity. For what I am using this for it's a perfect solution and built to last for a long time.",0.994,513,27.0,0.0,2.2982
"The review sample I received is perfect for campers who want the convenience of portable personal hygiene and light cleaning tasks.  The flow rate of this shower is 2.5 cubic inches per second, which manages to conserve water while providing sufficient pressure for wet-lather-rinse showers. To be sure this is not a high pressure pump and shower head, but is effective.<br /><br />It also works for light duty utensil rinsing and other similar tasks. You can even shampoo pets outside without using risky 110/120 volt power. The instructions are both clear and contain a lot of useful information. I recommend taking the time to read them over before using this shower head for the first time. There are a few gotchas that you need to heed, including not exceeding USB charging sources of 1.2 Amps.<br /><br />Assembly is simple, but you need to make sure you do not lose the hose O-ring (I store mine in a plastic envelope). Also you need to ensure that the filter is routinely cleaned, especially if you are camping and using treated spring, lake or river water. This works perfectly with the [[ASIN:B0009PUQVY Coleman PVC Double Wash Basin]] or similar basins. Make sure that whichever basin you use is sufficiently deep to completely submerge the pump. I recommend a minimum of four inches to be on the safe side.<br /><br />While the USB charging feature is a big plus, you can also use this with an [[ASIN:B00E3OL5U8 Anker 14W Solar Panel Foldable Dual-port Solar Charger]], which is perfect for camping.  You can get about an hour of use for every two to five hour charge. That is where the solar panel I cited comes in handy because you can truly leave the grid with this shower head and that panel when roughing it.",0.994,355,27.307692307692307,0.4,2.4182
"I am a minimalist when it comes to kitchen tools. I prefer fewer tools, but invest in the best. This is a knife that I was able to justify because I frequently eat fish. The surprise is that it did not cost a fortune.<br /><br />It is strictly a kitchen knife for me. I do not go fishing, so the leather scabbard is a nice way to safely store it in a drawer, but not a necessity. It, like the knife, is high quality and reflects excellent materials and craftsmanship.<br /><br />What I love is the attention to ergonomics. The handle is non-slip, which is another safety feature because the blade is razor sharp. In fact, the blade will hold an edge for quite some time before needing a steel for straightening, and then a honing.<br /><br />Another thing that I love is how flexible the blade it - this makes it a dream to filet and debone fish with a great deal of precision.<br /><br />Finally, the price is astounding. I would have never guessed that I could purchase a high quality knife for less than twenty bucks (which is the price at the time of this review.) Most competing knives in this range are, frankly, junk. Add in a high quality leather sheath and this is a great value.<br /><br />Care and cleaning is easy. I hand wash mine, and use a steel whenever I see minute nicks starting to show up on the blade edge. I then re-hone. Both tasks consume less than five minutes, and are needed no more than monthly even under moderately heavy use.<br /><br />I'm more than pleased with this knife - I am thrilled.

"There are a lot of flaps and poles that don't seem to make sense here. This is like high fashion, but in a tent. I wonder if the people who made this tent have ever gone camping. Specifically, backpacking where you are carrying things instead of driving to a camp site instead of driving there. If you're driving, I guess weight and useless gear won't make you as mad, but if you have to carry this, you are going to wonder, ""Why?"" If you're driving, there are much better wall tents. If you are backpacking, there are much better dome tents. This seems like a middle ground option that is never the best or optimal solution.",0.654,138,17.25,0.6,0.7762

The hinge already feels a bit loose, some of the inner coating chipped off and a small bit of plastic of the catch tray broke off. We did keep the old one for spare parts, so glad we did.

"I used a version of this device at the physical therapist and this one is a better quality. I tore a muscle in my upper arm (not once but twice!) and both times my shoulder “froze” up from lack of motion while healing.<br /><br />I found this style to be even more comfortable than what was at therapy, with its nicely padded handles. It looks like (from the seller pictures) they have improved the over-the-door hook, making it easier to reach and hook over the door..<br /><br />You just need to find a door that allows you to swing your arms in all different directions without running into something.<br /><br />I prefer sitting on a bar stool or chair but standing also works. I’m standing these days and needed to shorten the cords. I just wrapped them around the soft-padded handles and that worked for me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as a good way to keep up with maintaining flexibility. I haven’t been to the physical therapist in a few years, but I still use this device. Not only does it help me stretch and keep more limber, but I notice an improvement in my posture when I use it a few times a week. It also helps tone the areas along my sides and the backs of my upper arms.<br /><br />Honestly, it only takes me a few minutes to do some basic stretching and see results. If you could find a place to just leave it up all the time, that would make it even more convenient.<br /><br />I found this to be plenty sturdy and certainly affordable. You might even be able to use your FSA funds to cover the cost.<br /><br />Certainly easy to pack in a bag when traveling.<br /><br />It has never damaged my door or frame.<br /><br />I highly recommend and would purchase again.",0.9962,403,36.63636363636363,0.0,2.29886

This allows me to perform a wider variety of exercises and therefore allows me to work specific areas that are otherwise difficult to target without a gym available, and the 552 models provide enough weight for my current needs.

"I like how compact everything nicely fits into a very durable case. All of the accessories are quality made. I have used gun cleaning kits from many other manufacturers for cleaning engines and restoration cleaning of antiques. This one I can tell it will last it might be slower in ways compared to other methods yet it is gentle and really does an amazing job. Pulling the debris away from all of the areas that you do not want debris to be is critical for the life of everything from a firearm to an engine or anything else that requires the use of a cleaning kit like this. When you are finished using the kit clean everything up, put it away and you should have a tool kit that will last a long time. This is not a disposable or junk kit it is built to last just dont force it use common sense read instructions. I highly recommend this kit for anyone who is learning about firearms because it is simple to use. Used as the instructions say your not going to harm your investment you will protect it along with learning more about your firearms or whatever else you are cleaning.

"Works just fine. The trick is clean your optics with plain old regular hand soap and water or the correct optical cleaner that does not leave a residue drying them off thoroughly. You apply Scope Dope sparingly to a clean surface wipe it on wipe it off its really easy. I find 2 very light applications work the best. Try a little bit on a squeaky clean mirror in the bathroom before you take a shower see what happens. For a fun effect use your finger and lightly apply just enough for a word or phrase on the surface of a mirror or window that will get fogged up from steam. Next gently just using a light film wipe off the excess so you do not see the message you wrote.

"Overall:  Great sturdy alternative to door-mounted systems.  Carriages move relatively easily on the track.<br /><br />The Good:  We chose to mount it to a wooden board to keep it from sinking too far into the drywall, as other reviewers had mentioned might be necessary.  We didn’t have any problems with it but were being proactive.<br /><br />The bad:  I received a box with only one 3 foot section of track.  I contacted the seller and was able to get the remaining track sent pretty quickly.  When the new box came, it was a box identical to the original, containing only one 3-ft section of track.  Not that I was needing more than one section of track, but if they just shopped me another “product” off the shelf and this one also only had one track, that means there are probably others with only one section?  This leads me to wonder if there’s a packaging problem that is causing boxes to be sent with only one piece of track?<br /><br />More good:  The second package came with an additional carriage and all the hardware to install it, so that was good.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with the purchase.

Now it fits easily.<br />Obviously the larger 32 oz won't fit in a bike cage!",0.4691,188,31.33333333333333,0.3,2.23073
"From the perspective of my rear end, this seat is great. It is very comfortable. It looks good and has great suspension. I actually worried the sides had too much give, but once I am on it, it is perfect)<br />I had a LOT of trouble finding a bike seat that didn't aggravate my sit bones. So this seat is a godsend.<br />However my thighs disagree a little. The angle of the sides of the seat gets too wide too fast compared to the nose. So it rubs the back of the thighs as you push the pedals down.  But there isn't a better wide saddle out there on the market yet, so I just rub a little anti-chafe stick on there before I set off.<br />One caution - you have to tighten the clamp to the rails REALLY hard. Because if you don't, it will slip (mid-ride when you go over a bump!). If you want to keep it adjustable while you get used to it and decide the angle, bring the wrench with you on rides.",-0.365,213,21.3,0.0,1.4905000000000002
"This is my favorite water bottle. I own a bunch so I am never without. I prefer this to the kind with the straw because it is easier to clean.

I wanted something that I didn't have to actively think about using (so I could focus on TV rather than exercise boredom). The act of sitting in it with feet off the ground requires your core muscles to constantly engage. Plus legs and arms. Sure you can do crunches - but you don't have to.

"I use this water bottle for runs lasting up to one hour. Eight ounces isn't a lot of water and I try to drink 4 ounces every 20 minutes when it's hot and humid. So that's 40 minutes of water during the run and hydrating when you return. I can fit two of these bottle in my running belt with no bouncing and no leaking adding another 40 minutes of running. The bite valve works well and the water tastes fine, no plastic taste or smell. The bottle collapses as it empties and is easy to store when empty. I'm currently using these bottles during summer marathon training long runs. They save me from having to wear my hydration vest during these hot and humid days. The one downside is it's a little harder for me to fill these small soft flasks at water stations and I need to fill them more often due to the smaller size. So far the lighter weight has been a good trade off for the refill issues. One final note, these bottles are made for Salomon by HydraPak. HydraPak sells their own brand of soft flasks on Amazon.

Everything has a trade-off. The Yeti is the best I've ever had at twice the price... but is heavy and not my first choice to carry around. If weight is a factor... I'm going to reach for this one.

"Ruger should just add this excellent adaptor to their synthetic stock Mini-14 and Mini-30s. This is the first accessory I have added (there are many other functional upgrades) The ability to very quickly add and remove a bi-pod is great. Takes a little attention to detail like drilling+epoxying and possible trimming, but well worth the effort.  Depending on your shooting position and purpose... a bipod can potentially dramatically improved shot placement. This keeps pressure off your gas block. Never did like that other Mini14 contraption that clamps on over gas block. That device gets a rating of 1 star from me even though I am a diehard Harris fan",0.678,119,17.0,0.4,2.3234
"Perkins Carbon Steel Kukri arrived in Alaska from England in a timely fashion. Quality of blade and sheath are as advertised and described by other raters. Walked outside and attacked a grove of finger sized alder trees. With a long/thin flat blade like a machete I would expect a clean swift cut. I wasn't sure how a thick spined chopper like this would do. This kukri performed like a champ. A few deflected away, but most just sliced like butter. Blade is sharpened to a good angle that should prevent it from chipping. I have years of experience using my 3 Matindales (bolo and 2 machetes)and endless inexpensive machetes for brush clearing.  With medium carbon steel you quickly become an expert on filing out the nicks and recreating an edge and smooth blade ( over and over again) . This Perkins steel is nice and hard. Seems like the edge will be easier to maintain vs repair. That is a huge plus in the field.  Balance is excellent for the 10&#34; blade. The blade guard is outstanding. My only reason for not giving a five is the round handle/tapered pommel and no hole for a lanyard. With gloves and a little rain or elk blood I can see losing control and planting it where you don't want it to go. It would be nice to have the country of origin stamped into blade like the company Logo. Pleased with the quality and functionality. I think we will become close friends as I master how to safely use and sharpen. Wish I had a Kukri years ago.  This is a good place to start if you are thinking about one.

I have been using a pair of classic green Howard Leight Impact Sport protectors for almost 2 years. This morning I was out at the range between a .308 and a .44 magnum.  Never had an issue with the ones I use... The old ones fit well.. can wear over a cap. Fold up nice and compact.... and then I put these on.... Now I'm going to have a hard time going back to my old favorite pair. Sound dampening is amazing.. Especially a few feet from a .44 . Padding is a lot more comfortable. I recommend both.

"I have used this now with .223/ 30-30/ .380/ .44M/ .45.  It is a quality product. Logically the design makes sense that it will cover more surface area inside the bore. With a heavily fouled barrel it does not replace the need for a more aggressive brushing.  I do get by using maybe 1-2 fewer patches overall per deep cleaning, but I have yet to evaluate the cost/benefit gained. I now have this kit in my range bag and give an occasional swab down the barrel when I'm doing some major shooting with my Ruger Mini-14.  Seems to keep accuracy from degrading after every 20-30 rounds. Definitely makes terminal cleaning easier.  It's new.. it's a good idea... At the end of the day I agree that it might be faster... but not necessarily cleaner.  Passing a triangle through after my life long conventional cleaning technique... I do not find I am getting unmissed residue.

I lined the bottom with a cheap tarp and a vynyl table cover from the dollar store.  I added layers of newspaper on top and a wide cardboard box with a couple of old bath towels.  The kittens were born and kept safe and comfortable inside the tent for 5 to 6 weeks  ( good weather and  daily cleaning required )<br />Bought a second tent for my nieces (ages 10 and 5) to camp in my living room  ( sleepover) when they visit.<br /><br />What I did not like<br />It took me a few times to learn how to fold it back up again.

He was not amused.<br /><br />The feet settle into the gravel and rock in our driveway, but they are still wobbly compared to the Cabela chair - and that chair has smaller feet!

I just used boiling water from my little canned heat stove and added black pepper to all three flavors.<br /><br />The Mac & cheese got mushy, but was perfectly edible and doesn't taste bad at all. The Southwest mix has just way too much bell pepper taste for me - it was all I could taste and I ended up dumping it and having a PB&J sandwich instead.

Everything fits and is easy to access without dismounting first.<br /><br />I like the drape of the bag once it's full and in place. It stays within the saddle pad edges and isn't rubbing my horse anywhere. I can get on and off without banging in it because it doesn't rise above the horn. My only complaint thus far is a spot of seam stitches that are trying to come apart.

"WOW. This cot is not your old 1970s saggy summer camp at the lake cot. This thing is super sturdy with  heavy duty construction. It's not light by any means, but it does actually fit back in the bag when folded up.<br /><br />I am amazed at the fact that this is comfortable to lie on without an additional pad. I actually took a nap on it in the breeze yesterday. The canvas bed is taut and solid and you don't feel the cross bars under your back.<br /><br />There's a mesh covered pillow at the top that actually feels like a pillow rather than hard lump of foam. I still need a real pillow, but I could get away with just this for one night. There's enough room on the cot for a small to medium size dog to share with you as well.

"This the first shower tents we've ever had - I detest tent camping, but there are places I want to see that are only accessible by horseback, so camping is a necessary compromise. Despite being in a literal desert mountain wilderness, there's always the possibility of a random hiker passing by. So....privacy is a must for bathing and toilet needs.<br /><br />This is taller than I believed it would actually be. My husband is 6' 1"" and he was fine standing in it and mimicking a shower was fine as well. He had plenty of room to maneuver and twist without falling around.<br /><br />My little toilet system fits very well inside and there's lots of ventilation. The top unzips for a shower hose if you're using a set up like that. There's also a side window just for light and air flow as well.

"I'm using this as shade tarp on the West side of a corral for horses. We're in deep West Texas in the Chinati mountains and that means very serious UV rays and heat 9 months of the year. Our overhead shelter suffered a fatal collapse in a windstorm last week and had be taken down. (55 mph winds will do that)<br /><br />We put up posts and stretched this tarp over the top across to the man corral fence. It offers a lot of overhead shade throughout the day and doesn't make a weird snapping noise in wind. The reinforced  edges and attachment points make it very versatile and useful in oddball situations. We've only received a half inch of rain in 5 months,  so I can't speak to it being truly waterproof or not yet.

"My husband has big ol' Sasquatch feet and finding stirrups for his clown shoe sized boots is a pain. These fit both his saddle and his boots.<br /><br />They are plastic which is good and bad. Plastic makes them very light which is certainly better for our horses. But.. it also means the stirrups aren't as durable as wood versions out here in the Chihuahua Desert. Over time all plastic cracks in our intense sun and almost non-existent moisture in the air.<br /><br />Nonetheless, these are working pretty well on a well used ranch saddle.

"Well, in some ways this is a good hat, but it has flaws and it's priced way above it's league. We're in the Big Bend area of West Texas and that means sun, heat and hats at all times, year round. I have several in various styles and materials.<br /><br />This one looks nice, the colors are great. The listing says it's adjustable, but that is only for the chin strap, not the body of the hat. If you have a larger head, this isn't for you, my medium head fits fine, but there's no extra space.<br /><br />As to the cooling effect....once it gets wet, it wets your head and evaporation causes a cooling sensation. This was noticable on a 2 hour hike along the Rio Grande this morning. However, let's just get real for a second.....a thin, wet towel over your head does exactly the same thing. There's nothing special going on with this hat to cool you after it gets wet.<br /><br />The brim offers plenty of shade over your face and neck which is exactly what any brimmed hat should do. Unfortunately, the construction of the brim is not great. After a single hike, I realized the edge of it is coming apart already.

"As a rule, I do not use shanked bits or curb bits for my horses. If they can't behave or perform as asked in a simple copper or rubber snaffle, then we need to go back to basic training because I haven't finished the horse's education.<br /><br />However, we're working with a neighbor's mare who arrived with a nasty shanked bit and narrow chain curb. She also came with bruises to her bars and chin and sore lips. I've moved the mare to an old fashioned grazing bit and this leather curb strap while we work on re-schooling her. She's responding well and no longer flinging her head or gaping at the mouth to avoid pain. Eventually, she may be fully safe to ride anywhere and comfortable in a bitless bridle, but between now and then, this leather curb is fine.<br /><br />It fits properly and doesn't pinch or twist or roll over. It makes contact without pain or excessive pressure. I've been able to get the mare out on back country trails under complete control without punishing her mouth every time I touch the reins.",0.4652,223,27.875,0.4,2.25956
"This is really well constructed and put together. It's feels heavy/solid but not bulky in the hand or in a backpack.<br /><br />We've been using it to spot wildlife on hikes and horseback riding in the Chihuahua Desert. I find the optics easy to adjust and use. I like the overall portability and long battery life.<br /><br />We have noticed that the distance can be off a fair amount in some circumstances. It seems like in the desert flats, there's a problem accurately measuring - I think it's because everything out here is essentially shades of the same colors and sized/shaped similarly. (Like boulders, shrubs, cactus etc) In town, where the buildings etc have distinct shapes, we find this gives correct information. For our primary needs, it's fine to see jackrabbits, javelina, big horn sheep and eagles as long as I don't need an accurate distance.",0.9647,183,26.142857142857142,0.1,1.91941
"Two months ago, I had a custom saddle built on an existing 50 year old mesquite tree. (I found the tree in Mexico in perfect condition) This has been an amazing process and the saddle is 90% perfect. My issue was the new stirrups and leather fenders....so stiff and that equates to knee and ankle pain trying to break everything in over time.<br /><br />These stirrup turners were EXACTLY what I needed. Holy cow! Immediate comfort and correct placement. They do add length so you definitely need to adjust your stirrups. I ended up going up three holes for proper leg placement after adding these. Fortunately, my saddle maker measured my short legs and added extra holes to compensate.<br /><br />The addition of these turners means I can mount safely from anywhere and instantly find my right stirrup without looking. The stirrups stay in the correct angle and are balanced even on rough, steep mountain trails. That's a big deal out in the Big Bend desert mountains of West Texas. Installation was quite simple and took just a few minutes. My only complaint is because these are so thick and stiff (they have to be) my ankles can take a beating after several hours on the trails. Even in tall boots. I've begun wrapping them in vet wrap just to add a bit of cushion and that has helped significantly. I'm coming in from hard, long rides without limping anymore because my stirrup placement is finally set up correctly.",0.9056,292,19.466666666666665,0.8,2.51168

I was looking for a light sleeping back for equestrian overnight treks. Something that rolls small and can be put in a backpack or a saddle bag.<br /><br />This one meets those basic requirements.

It was definitely cooler for my horse than our old neoprene cinch was and he was absolutely more comfortable due to the softness.

It molds to my stallion's body a bit better and doesn't shift on steep climbs. The lining is fluffy and thick - it will flatten after a couple of rides and that's fine. It is wicking sweat and not getting soaked and stiff right away. My only complaint is this isn't quite as big as it said and that means I have to buy yet another, longer pad when I need to use saddle bags.

He was a smidge more tired tonight than normal after an 8 mile ride over some very rough country. Nothing serious, we were both tired.<br /><br />I applied this to his lower legs after his bath and some BioFreeze to mine. We both felt refreshed after. This bottle is great. It offers a brief continuous burst spray even upside down. The smell dissipates very quickly.

We have never really found a powdered milk that was truly palatable. Until now. This stuff mixes without any powdery residue or grit left behind. It looks like milk and tastes pretty good for powdered milk. We've used it for mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. Everything tasted like it should and nothing was watery.

We're riding in the desert and mountains over wild, big, rough country and this bit adds a little extra comfort for my horse.<br /><br />I don't ride him with anything other than a simple headstall, regular saddle and this bit. No tie downs or curb chains or nosebands. He responds beautifully and is not a crazy stud. We've used this bit 3 or 4 times a week and he's grazed a little with it on the trails - regular use.

"I'm starting to ride in a treeless saddle in prep for a couple of 25 mile overnight horse trips. Going from a 30lb Western saddle to a 9lb treeless is necessary for our terrain and distances. But that also requires a learning curve on basic equipment like pads and girthing.<br /><br />My stallion was not impressed by the treeless saddle with a regular all purpose pad under it. Flat ears and resistance are incredibly rare from him, so I knew we had to find something new. This pad elevates the withers area just a little bit and provides more cushioning from the direct contact of the treeless saddle.

"This is mac and cheese with the spiral pasta rather than elbow noodles. I'm very happy to see that they are not using any soy at all - it's an allergy safe food for me.<br /><br />We tried it in our RV tonight and it wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either. Just add boiling water, mix and let it rehydrate for 7 minutes or so is what the can says. We found still dry, crunchy  noodles at 7 minutes. 10 minutes was fully rehydrated/cooked.<br /><br />The flavor is fine and once we added cracked black pepper to it, it was good. This makes a pretty creamy end product with definite cheese flavor. I can see carrying a couple of servings with me on overnight horse treks.

We've hiked through a canyon and a rugged cross desert trail with a 1200 foot elevation increase using this pack.<br /><br />It stays balanced and in place despite climbing up or down steep inclines, scrambles over boulders and through mesquite trees. I don't feel top heavy wearing it as long as it's packed properly. The shoulder straps could use a bit more padding with heavy loads, but I think that's just me.",0.461,157,31.4,0.0,2.1383

The included bag is really cheap, thin plastic with sharp edges. It was just garbage and I threw it out.<br /><br />The straw seems to filter, but there's no way to really know how well.

Unfortunately, the nose band was still too big despite adjustments and the curb strap was very stiff and difficult to fit. What ended up happening was the metal sides were digging into my boy's face and the nose band was still shifting and slipping down. All of which defeated the purpose of not harrassing him.<br /><br />The overall construction was fine for a beginner mechanical hackamore and the nose piece was well padded. After an hour of fiddling with this thing and swapping through 3 different head stalls, I just couldn't make it work or fit comfortably at all. I ended up returning the whole thing.

"My husband is a retired Federal Agent and certified weapons specialist and military armorer certified by seven weapons manufacturers annually. He knows weapons and accessories both on a professional and personal level. He has carried a weapon daily openly and concealed for well over 37 years. He decreed that this holster is at best useless and at worst, dangerous.<br /><br />First, it had no metal clip to attach to a belt. Second, the strap to secure the extra magazine is thin and easily undone by accident. Third and most importantly, the safety snaps are cheap, weak clothing style snaps. These snaps are supposed to hold your pistol securely in the holster - preventing an amateur mistake where it slips or slides up as you move. Instead, literally the lightest pressure pops the snaps loose unintentionally. That's a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because we can replace the straps ourselves in the shop and the rest of the physical holster is decently stitched and secure.

Especially with dogs. That means we use freezer packs a lot.<br /><br />I was very surprised at how thin these pack are when I first saw them. However,  the long, thin, flat shape is actually great. You can layer these between stacks of stuff and everything gets cold exposure and stays organized  in the cooler.  They also slide into the fridge along the sides and stay put without taking us tons of space. They took 5 hours to thaw entirely in the good cooler with minimal activity and in 90 degrees.

"First, I must say that I'm using these mats a little differently than most folks probably will. I have one or two under various dog beds on a slick, hard wood floor. The beds tend to slide around on those floors and in winter a bit of cold can sleep through as well.<br /><br />These mats fit comfortably under most of our dog beds and have stopped the beds from sliding around. They also offer a bit of additional padding and my elderly dogs like that. The mats are thick enough to help block the chill once winter rolls in. That's exactly what I wanted to accomplish, so I'm happy.",0.9017,129,21.5,0.0,2.27051
"I love these thin, soft shirts for humid summer days. I don't care one bit about football or the teams, so this logo could be anything and I wouldn't pay attention.

It converts to a backpack style if you don't want it over the shoulder and the straps are well made and nicely stitched.<br /><br /> I used this at a small, local horseshow the other day  and it was great. Dirt and whatnot just brushed right off the exterior. We carried extra riding gloves, a horse bit that needed repairs, boot polish rags, tissues, mane braiding bands and a comb, a bunch of random small stuff plus water.

I like this two towel set for dog towels in the car. The small one is great for wrapping a fast food Coke cup or water bottle in the heat. It absorbs all the condensation and my cup holder never gets wet. The bigger one has been good with drying dogs and paws after a walk and a swim in a creek. It also stats put over the cargo area cover when the seats are flat for the dogs.

"When you are married to a professional armorer, you tend to have every weapon-type related gadget made. We have laser sights on three p.s.i.t.o.l.s. already, but this is the first green one. It's also the least expensive one we've ever seen. My husband put it through its paces and he's satisfied with it in certain circumstances.<br /><br />This installed on a Smith and Wesson 9mm with a factory rail and took about 30 seconds to put on and secure. Lining up the sight took a couple of tries to get it right and aiming properly - it wants to track to the right when first attached. They do include the tools for this fortunately. We both felt like it is reasonably true shooting a single magazine. He did have to readjust the light before we went through a second magazine.<br /><br />The green light is bright and easier to see in daylight for me than my red one. It's also very easy to see inside in the dark - if you have to address an intruder, this could be helpful. As a beginners' first laser sight, this isn't bad at all. It's definitely affordable and the USB charging is simple. However, the light is essentially invisible from 31 feet on in daylight....that's not a deal breaker, just slightly less visibility than our red lasers. It is a decent beginner sight.",0.9907,274,19.571428571428573,0.0,1.89721

The handle on top is sturdy and makes it easy to carry by fingers only.<br /><br />The filter is easy to install and can be replaced when needed. I think it does significantly improve the taste of basic well water and I noticed a small improvement in out city water.

The stun action is very fast and it definitely makes some noise and throws a bit of sparky light. I'm certain it would show down a bad guy at least long enough to let me get to my real firearm. My concern is the contact prongs being a little flimsy - one or two strikes will be fine,  but if you used this a lot (can't imagine those circumstances!) the contacts will probably bend and malfunction.",0.2516,199,22.11111111111111,0.0,1.67548
"We have a similar kit we put together from various individual pieces over the years and it lives at the cabin in West Texas. My husband wanted another one for the truck so I tried this. The individual pieces are ok quality and should survive mild, limited use.<br /><br />The fire starter does throw decent sparks for fire making. The knives and hatchet are fine for basic survival uses in a true crisis. We were able to chop a small branch and peal the bark off it with the hatchet and bigger knife. The paracord wraps gives you a bunch of cord for various applications.<br /><br />However, our complaint is the sheaths. Not one of them fits properly and you have to wiggle the blades around to get them into the sheath - how many times can you do that before you cut yourself or dull the blades?

I figured this was the exact spot to try this degreaser on.<br /><br />It has a very strong citrus scent - not bad, but don't make the mistake of spraying it close to your nose. I just used a couple of regular paper towels and literally wiped away all the grease, dust, and excess cleaner in three strokes.

"This is not a solid gel type of freshener, it's very liquid and soft which means if you accidentally tip it over, it will make a mess. Nonetheless, this stuff works. I put it in our 22 yearbold farm truck - that's the truest test possible. That truck has a myriad of foul scents caked into its molecules - wet dogs, old cigarette smoke, manure from dirty boots, old dampness, ranch workers' sweat, years of fast food and who knows what else.<br /><br /> I left this gel cup in the truck for 24 hours and this morning drove it to to do some fence repair. I am pretty amazed at the improvement - it's almost like I had the interior professionally cleaned. The tea tree scent is very strong, but there's a real reduction in the old, stale, gunky odor that was in the truck two days ago. My only complaint is that I can't have this in the truck while I'm in it - it's so strong, I actually got a headache.",0.8587,207,29.571428571428573,0.3,2.34761

Carrying this rifle for a short forty minute hike was comfortable - over a longer period or on a heavier weapon he would prefer a flat leather sling instead. The benefit of course, with this sling is the length of cord available for multiple uses in the event of an emergency.

"This is a good backpack for basic day hikes in nice weather with regular stuff. The shoulder straps are padded well enough for my light duty needs, but I don't know that I would want to carry this pack fully loaded for several days. I do like the pocket on the waist area for quick access to keys and my phone though.<br /><br />There's enough room inside for a change of clothes, extra shoes, the rubber shoes for the dogs, dog water bowl, snacks for me and the dogs, extra flexi leash, basic first aid kit, water bottles for me and the dogs, my pistol, flashlight, emergency survival kit, a map and compass. When we hike, it's typically in the deep West Texas deserts of Big Bend, Terlingua and the Chinati mountains along the Rio Grande at the ranch. We don't camp out there deliberately, but you must always be prepared for whatever the Chihuahuan Desert throws at you.<br /><br />My one star deduction is because this pack isn't really water resistant like it claims. A single, light shower and everything was slightly damp. Not wet, but heading that way. The reason mostly is because there's a ventilation hole on the top center on the back and it might as well be open. There is an included rain cover sheet thing so it's not a total loss, but still....don't carry this if you think you'll be out in inclement weather.",0.9373,292,32.44444444444444,0.0,1.8811900000000001
"1999 was the last time I actually owned a bicycle. When I saw this one, it struck a chord of nostalgia in me so I thought I ought to give casual biking another try. This is a very casual, suburbia type bike. No bells (literally no bell) and no frills or fancy gears to mess with. It's meant for just tooling along in a relaxed manner on shady, wide, well paved, low traffic neighborhood streets. I'll be honest, I have never understood or cared about the difference between men's and women's bikes - frankly, that lowered center bar on women's bikes always seemed like it would be the safer option for a man to me.<br /><br />This has to be assembled when it arrives and that drives me nuts. The box is enormous and already weighs over 70lbs. Sending it fully assembled couldn't possibly be significantly more difficult and it would definitely be easier on the customer. This thing requires multiple hex wrenches and regular wrenches to put together and if you've never done it before, it's complicated. I ended up having to get a friend to help me out because some of the bolts were torqued so tight that I couldn't undo them to attach the handle bars. (Someone with previous bike building experience might not experience the frustrations that I did) We ended up leaving off the front fender because it bent and dented when I tried to install by myself.<br /><br />Actually riding this bike is fine. It's nicely balanced and the tires are wide enough that I don't feel like I'm teetering around. It travels smoothly down paved neighborhood streets and paved bike trails in our city parks. There are no handle bar brakes though, you have to push the pedals back to brake - I've forgotten how to do that smoothly in the past 20 years and bounced myself off this bike twice already.

After 12 hours in my truck, there was still some actual ice in the bottle. At 24 hours no more ice, but the water was reasonably cold.

I set it up on our back patio and it's definitely bigger than I expected - the cat promptly stalked in and around it and settled down for a shady nap.<br /><br />The umbrella pops open very quickly and has a button to close it again - that's good because it's heavy and ackward if you try to close it manually. The side wings pop out immediately and there are little bag/pockets inside for your light weight stuff. The two windows unzip and definitely allow for a cross breeze.<br /><br />I used the floor fabric as a door on the front and it fits well enough to offer a bit of privacy if you needed to change clothes quickly. As a floor cover, this is decent for keeping you off the dirt or sand directly. I'm excited to take this with us out to the Big Bend area this summer as a portable shade for our dogs on our cabin porch and down by the river.

Extra leashes, first aid kits, bottles of water, emergency cans of dog food, wipes, flashlight, a rope, gloves, and more. I've been using an open top box, but this is so much better.<br /><br />It has a lower storage area that's propped up with velcroed panels, mesh pockets and zips closed - perfect for the spare dog treats, food and odds and ends. The top half is divided in two spaces and has more mesh pockets and it zips closed as well. It holds the first aid stuff and things you might need in a hurry.<br /><br />My problem here is the low quality zippers. They peel apart in the middle with very little pressure. The entire zipper and tabs feel flimsy and cheap - because they are. It's easy to unzip the top cover far enough that the whole thing falls off. That sort of renders the cover useless.

"We don't hike per se, but we do head out to the ranch in the deep West Texas borderlands a couple of times a year and you absolutely need water on your person out there. The Chihuahua desert and Chinati mountains combined with extreme temperatures out there can cause a serious hydration problem very quickly. Typically, I put two one gallon containers per person in our saddle bags and we ride out. I like the idea of having this water pouch for walking with it's built in straw.<br /><br />The pouch itself is easy to see with clear sections in the camo print so you know exactly how much water you have left. The straw has a pull off cover and it pops back into place with a firm click so you know it's really closed. The fill opening is wide enough to refill with a water hose or just using the regular old kitchen faucet. I was surprised that the pouch has absolutely no plastic or chemical scent whatsoever.<br /><br />My problem is the lack of velcro or any sort of straps to attach it to a backpack or belt. Basically, you have to carry it or already have a backpack with existing straps or a pocket available to hold a water pouch. It this had an attached loop even on the top, I could clip it my saddle or my jacket - I rarely use a backpack when on horseback so we'll have to retrofit something to this.",0.0799,281,31.22222222222222,0.0,1.6239700000000001
"My husband rarely hunts anymore, but periodically we have herds of wild hogs that work their way into the horse farm pastures. These devils are incredibly destructive and definitely dangerous - a boar will charge a grown man and our horses when startled. The cold winter nights and predawn mornings are best for tracking and exterminating problem hogs. (Texas allows you to process the meat and donate it, so lots of good can be done with hog hunts.)<br /><br />These pants are exactly what my husband needs as winter enters our area. He tried them early this morning (over long johns) with temperatures around 38 degrees - not bitterly cold, but traipsing through a creek and the pond run off can add an extra chill if you fall. The lower pants legs were muddy and damp, but his legs were dry and warm.<br /><br />The inside lining is a soft, thick material that doesn't cause him to sweat, but definitely keeps him warm. The reinforced knees and seat area are comfortable without being bulky. I'm pretty sure he appreciated that lined seat area while he was crouched under bushes at dawn - his backside was dry. He didn't get a hog today, but scared a pack of five away and he wasn't cold doing it. That's a win in our book.",0.9588,262,23.818181818181817,0.1,2.31764
"I rarely golf and the grips on my clubs are about 8 years so I figured that it was probably time for re-gripping them. I'm glad these grips came as a complete set because I had no clue what all was involved. I'm actually amazed at the difference between my old grips and these new ones - my old ones were hard and had a weird texture going on.<br /><br />For me the hardest part was removing my old grips, but it was worth it. I watched several videos on line to be sure I wasn't going to mess things up and wind up having to pay a pro to fix it. These grips are soft and feel good in the hand. There's a distinct texture on these that is easy to hold. I doubt my swing is any better (I only good for social stuff and I am pathetic), but my game isn't worse after using these.",0.9721,181,25.857142857142858,0.0,1.8916300000000001
We used these cups during our July 4th BBQ with success. No one spilled any drinks because the cups are a bit more sturdy than the usual red cups. The tops are wide and seem reinforced a bit - makes it easy to mix drinks in each cup.<br /><br />The clear plastic allows you to write highly visible names on the cups. That's definitely handy when you have several kids around. And the plastic means they are safe for the kids to carry outside by the pool.,0.9423,100,20.0,0.0,2.28269
"This is enormous. It holds a tray of ice cubes and plenty of ice tea or if you're really having a DAY... Long Island Iced Tea. The top dispenses easily and the looped handle is pretty strong.<br /><br />I'm not using this bottle as much as I thought I would for two simple reasons. It doesn't fit in the car cup holders and it has to be balanced in the passenger seat to take it with me. If you have a weak grip, your hand is a bit wet, you have small hands or you have a bandaid on one finger it can be almost impossible to drink from one handed. The exterior is slippery to hold onto - I've dropped it twice now trying to use it with just one hand. I do like the fact that this bottle keeps my cold drinks cold and it hasn't suffered from running through the dishwasher, it's just too big to use on horseback or in the car.",0.9172,190,27.142857142857142,0.1,1.9051600000000002
"Update Jan 23 2016. Downgrade two stars. I'm quite annoyed this morning because in less than 30 days, the so called 6 month life battery is completely dead. That means the unit is not functional at all and if I want to continue to use it, I have to trek to a store and buy a new battery. Really? Three weeks and it's already dead.<br /><br />*******original review follows*****<br />MOOV is the first fitness tracker that I have used and it's impressive by any standard. My primary concern about wearing one of these type devices was exposure to water and falling off when I am working with the horses. Ten days of nonstop wear (including in the shower every day) and the unit is still on my wrist and has shown no problems at all.<br /><br />I've done a few of the program work outs using the app on my phone and I really like the voice coaching in real time reaction to my speed, cadence, and distance. The connection between the tracker and my phone is instant. You get a visual breakdown on the app of your movement, moments of sloth and calories burned. Plus it keeps track of your progress as you improve each time you repeat a workout.<br /><br />All that is nice, but I have benefited the most from the MOOV's ability to track my sleep patterns and determine when and how long I'm actually sound asleep vs just a light sleep. What I've learned is that I need to go to bed earlier! I hardly notice that this thing is on my wrist now, mostly just when I choose to manually sync the tracker to the app. I am really looking forward to using the swimming options with it once it warms up and our pool isn't ice cold anymore.",0.8916,373,26.642857142857142,0.1,1.4974800000000001
"This is the second of the Daphne golf club covers that I am trying - the first was the adorable Weimaraner dog head and it was stolen in minutes by our Plott Hound. (Traveler loves it, by the way). This horse head is MINE.<br /><br />The construction quality is excellent with thick, sturdy stiches and thick, quality materials. The soft, sherpa style material inside that goes against the club head won't scratch and will definitely protect my clubs from damage in transit. This particular cover has a lot of cute extra details - pricked, upright ears, a fuzzy mane that moves and plastic eyes.<br /><br />I'm using this on a #1 oversized wood and it does fit, but it's a little tight. Not so tight that it's a struggle to remove or stretching the material at all. But the cover doesn't flop over or shift around at all once it is on. That's good - you just have to take a moment to remove it with both hands. I will probably buy a couple of the other designs in this line as time goes by.",0.8794,224,24.88888888888889,0.0,2.26382
"Well.... I had certainly INTENDED to use this super cute Weimaraner head cover on my driver. I say intended because it was stolen from under my very nose this morning. It certainly suits my personality and because I rarely play golf, it can't hurt to keep my clubs covered with something really nice. While I was inspecting the Weimaraner cover, I noted that it was very well made and seemed quite sturdy. The material is thick and soft and the interior is lined with a really high quality sherpa type soft material so it won't scratch your expensive clubs when in use.<br /><br />I set this down on the kitchen table and went to retrieve my clubs from the garage. When I returned, the dog cover was gone - vanished. I searched for 10 minutes until my husband tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to the living room ottoman. Our giant Plott Hound, Traveler, had absconded with the Weimaraner head cover and claimed it as his own. I gently took it back and he gently put one paw on my arm and his teeth on the nose of the cover. Bottom line here is that this thing now belongs to Traveler and my golf clubs are on their own. It's a pretty cute dog toy though as it turns out - see the photo.",0.9813,252,21.0,0.2,2.35439
"I have a really nice 12 year old Olympus camera that has been all over the world with me and has documented my best memories &amp; experiences. The different carrying cases have never lived up to the expectations or sometimes harsh environments my beloved camera has.<br /><br />This Thule bag is surprisingly well made and much bigger than my best case. (See the photo for side by side comparison) This bag holds my camera and a portable tripod with some finagling of the included padded pieces. Those pieces are designed with Velcro to fit and attach in whatever shape or spot you need - which means you aren't limited to using only items that fit in pre-made pockets.<br /><br /> The zippered lid pocket has a perfect pouch for batteries, USB cords and other small odds and ends. Inside the bag is a separate pocket for a tablet.  Once I put my camera and tripod in, my 10&quot; Fire will only fit if I take the case off of it first, so that's not great. There are two elastic pockets on the outside and a flat front zippered pocket on the front with a snap for your keys. Conceivably, you could hit the trail with just this bag carrying your camera stuff, a bottle of water, your id &amp; keys and maybe a light, small snack. I have had this out at the barn &amp; a horse show for photos of the horses and it works fine, but it will take some time to get used to the bulk of this bag for trekking through a jungle or climbing ruins in Central America or Asia.",0.7964,318,35.333333333333336,0.3,2.3289199999999997
"Hangman's noose. That's the first thing I thought when I put this shirt on this morning. It's just a very weird fit on me and I find this disappointing indeed because I absolutely love my Craft wool layering shirt in medium.<br /><br />This one is very body skimming and mine says slim fit on the tag, so I expected it to cling to every curve and lump etc. The fabric is a mix of polyester and elastane with a weave pattern for cooling during exercise, including a sort of open net look in the underarms.<br /><br /> I am a true size 8 and the other shirt in medium fits me with extra fabric - it actually is a hair big, but this one is really too tight across the bust and the throat is way too small. To the point of making me feel like I was choking. I'm not sure if my particular shirt is mis-marked or if they have a problem with inconsistent sizing at the manufacturing level.

"We have been using the heavy-duty Pelican cases for years with the long guns and for good reasons, so I was quite interested to see this case from Flambeau. My primary question was if the construction quality was comparable with Pelican since the two are priced similarly.<br /><br />This one is marketed as extra large and they aren't joking - see my photos. I have placed two shotguns and a rifle (all with different barrel lengths) in the case for comparison purposes to show the size. And of course the two handguns for scale. You can absolutely carry scoped rifles without trouble or damage in this case. There are three layers of foam, including a pick and pull customizable layer.<br /><br />It's a good thing this has two handles and wheels because empty, this case weighs at least 20lbs. Once you've packed it for a hunting trip or a run to the skeet range, it's not like grabbing that generic, fabric rifle case you used to use. This is the big leagues. The wheels seem pretty sturdy and roll smoothly on tile and cement, but they aren't meant for dirt. How they will perform long term remains to be seen.<br /><br />I do like that Flambeau took a page from the Pelican book and has reinforced the plastic hinges with steel. See the photo. The hinges are the natural weak point, so this should help increase longevity. The hinges do move smoothly and without hanging up. There are two stainless locking connections for padlocks - always a good idea whether you fly or not.<br /><br />I hauled this monster out to the farm yesterday with the Remington 870 for a bit of target practice. I threw it in the back of the truck and went. My husband's shotgun was just as pristine when I got there as it was before I left. (Whew) The case had no damage other than some hay and dirt on the outside - none got inside.

"I don't play golf often at all, because I am terrible - think every stereotype of the southern wife with coiffed hair and pretty new golf shoes that match her pretty new golf sweater borrowing some clubs, driving the cart once a year. Yeah, that's me. I learned enough about the game to keep my husband company on the rare charity couples game. I thought this set would be a nice addition to his golf stuff.<br /><br />I went out the other day with some friends who actually play regularly and I shot 7 holes with them - I had to leave early because....Shame. What I learned was that the small towel in this set is good for cleaning your putter off after you've essentially dug oil with it in the sand three inches off the actual green. The big, tri-fold towel looks rough, but does a fine job wiping sweat off your brow and muffling the curse words when you hit the fourth ball in a row into the woods, never to be seen again. (If only the balls were tethered by grommets)<br /><br /> The fork style divot damage repair tool worked ok for me after I was shown how to use it properly - turns out you need to push down and then gently push the soil/turf in toward the damage. Never lift up because that breaks the roots. This isn't a high end, super fancy set, but I like that it isn't covered in logos.",0.8815,288,32.0,0.0,1.8644500000000002

I am using this towel in that environment and I really like it. The carabineer attaches easily to my saddle ring and the towel weighs essentially nothing so I can have it on hand no matter where I am. The waffle weave seems like it would be a little rough on the face, but it really is soft and very absorbent.

No rubbing or slipping despite the lack of billet straps - as long as your saddle fits properly, this pad should stay in place. My one complaint is that after multiple trips through the washing machine, despite line drying only, the stuffing has begun to bunch up in a few places. Of course... after all this time, I guess I've gotten my money's worth out of the pad.

"I have an old push button umbrella that I have used for 8 or 9 years now with no drama. I picked this one to try because I was skeptical that anything new might actually be going on with umbrellas. Turns out that my old umbrella is now relegated to the horse barn and this new Totes umbrella is going in my truck.<br /><br />This one is large enough around for two similarly sized adults to stand under at once - my neighbor is 6'8&quot; and he &amp; I are never going to comfortably share an umbrella. The push button opening is smooth and quick, closing it is a push of that same button and then you push the entire pole into the handle until it clicks. My unit is very stiff for that final push, but I think that will loosen with use and time.<br /><br />The claim of water running off faster so the fabric stays drier than other umbrellas seems to be true. I used it today in a downpour and the rain rolled/slid off like the entire thing was coated in teflon.

Usually dehydrated foods are flavorless and lifeless, but this chicken and dumpling concoction actually smells like chicken when you open the package and you can recognize the peas & carrots immediately. (see the photo)<br /><br /> I added the cup and a half of boiling water to the pouch per the directions, sealed the pouch and let it cook for 12 minutes. Opening the pouch releases a chickeny aroma and everything is sort of mushy and definitely cooked and ready to eat. The texture is fine - the chicken chunks are edible and not rubbery at all. The carrots & peas are fine as well. The only issue was with some of the dumplings - these are made of biscuits instead of noodle based and some of them were actually a bit crunchy. I'm not sure if this was deliberate or if maybe I should have used a little more water than the directions suggest. There's not real broth with the cup and a half - it's more like a bowl of porridge.

(I do not use tie downs or anything like that. Stallions must be gentle or gelded in our barn.) The rollers here give him something to do and think about on slower walking sections of a trail or stops and the bit is just a tiny bit heavier than a regular d-ring.

"This is a pretty decent pistol cleaning rod. The handle allows you to get a good grip, but doesn't render the rod unwieldy or add extra weight. This kit comes with five patches and one .45 caliber jag, so it is actually ready to use immediately.  The one star deduction is because the wording on the package label is misleading. It indicates that this kit is ready to go for both a .22 and .45 caliber pistol and includes the jag for both. It does NOT have the .22 jag.

One caveat, the mummy style means this bag narrows considerably at the bottom, so if you are a larger/wide person, you'll need to check the measurements before ordering. The zipper operates smoothly and didn't snag despite multiple zipping. I like the Velcro tag at the top - you can secure the zipper and the hoodie while you're in it to keep the draft away if you're outside.

In the winter I usually leave the front door open just a tad, and that helps. The flip side is I have slept in it in below freezing weather and have stayed warm in a very cheap $20 sleeping bag. I think mine in the bag weighed in at around 3 lbs. I've since replaced the poles with Easton aluminum poles and titanium stakes. Cost about $50. I got the tent on sale for $20. Without all the bags, weight is now under 2 lbs. Any tent in that weight range cost at least $300.

This is not really a replacement. It will keep you plenty warm into the mid-40s, it is synthetic, which is far more forgiving than down, it will tolerate staying compressed, and will dry quickly, and the price makes it a value.

So to accommodate this I switch the cable side to a different hand each set.  In one photo the cable is wrapped around the bar several times and looks like it is centered.

It's the right size to hold a towel, shoes. etc. for one person (even a large-sized person like me).  The dimensions are listed in the description so be sure it's big enough for your intended use (I would not recommend this as a &#34;family&#34; bag to hold multiple items for multiple people).  It's a wonderful color -- vibrant blue and turquoise with orange trim -- so it's easy to spot from a distance.

"I'm a long-time fan of Nalgene bottles, purchasing my first one about 15 yrs ago.  I purchased this Pink Bloom version to take on a vacation this summer, mainly because I wanted a gray bottle, and this fit that criterion plus it has the added pink/white/dark gray pattern.<br /><br />What's not to like?  Sturdy, easy to clean, holds 32 oz so I can keep track of how much I'm drinking each day (I usually try to drink 2 of these full of either ice water or caffeine-free iced tea).  I've washed this bottle in the dishwasher twice so far, and the pattern is holding up.  It remains to be seen how long the pattern holds up, but I'll be hand washing it on this trip, so I'm not anticipating any problems.  Totally worth 5 stars in my book.",0.9301,167,27.83333333333333,0.7,2.48903
"I now have 3 of these, and love them!  They're the perfect addition to my Nalgene 32-oz bottles and make drinking from the bottle easier.  I still have my wide-mouth Nalgene bottle which makes it easy to add ice cubes/etc., but I have a smaller opening to drink from, making inadvertent spills less likely.  It's dishwasher safe, too.  My first two are 3 yrs old and showing now signs of wear at all.  No leakage with normal use, either.  (&#34;Normal use&#34; for me is to fill the bottle in the morning, then carry it in my computer bag or in my car, mostly upright, not on its side.)<br /><br />I just purchased this gray/black version to take on a cruise to Alaska along with a new Nalgene bottle.  No complaints at all -- really nice cap replacement",0.9448,172,19.11111111111111,0.0,2.28344
"I've been using Nalgene bottles for a lot of years -- at least 16 or so -- and they really do set the standard.

Fill it with ice tea, and I'm set for the afternoon.  BPA-free, no plastic-y taste transfer.  Just the ideal water bottle.",0.9263,164,32.8,0.1,2.30789

I love that I can easily manage my smaller items using a single square, and link them together to handle the larger items.  I  cover the surface with plastic wrap so the water doesn't soak into the foam -- I also worry about colorfastness -- and use stainless steel t-pins to hold the item while it's drying.  The thickness of the foam squares is just right for my needs -- no complaints at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended to other thread crocheters looking for a more economical way to block your work.",0.8605,180,36.0,0.9,2.52815
"I got these to replace the zipper pulls on a pair of zippered compression knee-highs.  The original pulls were plastic &#34;snap-on&#34; type, and they pulled out the first time I tried to use them.  Saw these, and took a chance.<br /><br />VERY happy I did!  These are the perfect size, very strong, and work perfectly.  If you've never worn compression stockings, you may not realize how strong the compression is.  These socks were rated at 40-50mmHg compression, so one of the highest ratings.  That means that it takes a LOT of effort/force to get the zipper up, and for someone like me (not young, not lithe, not flexible, not skinny) having some sort of help is necessary.  With these, I can use one hand to hold the two sides of the zipper together, and use the pull to work the zipper up.  The textured pull is non-slip, so even if my hands are a little damp, these are fine.  Whew!  These helped make what could have been a two-person job into a one-person effort, and I'm able to don the socks in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />The cord is surprisingly strong, and so far, I've had no issues at all with the textured plastic &#34;pull&#34; part popping off.  I've used the same pair of these on the socks daily for the past 3 weeks, and they show no signs of wear or durability issues.  (Photo included ... )<br /><br />Highly recommended!",0.9851,317,24.384615384615383,0.3,2.3855299999999997
"I debated giving this 3 stars instead of 4, but for its intended use (primarily camping), it works nicely.<br /><br />It couldn't be easier to prepare: add a cup of boiling water, stir, seal pouch, and wait 5-6 minutes (you can also open the pouch after 3 minutes, stir, then reseal wait another 2-3 minutes).  Drain off excess water (I snipped a corner of the pouch about 1/4"" to create a drain).  Then eat right out of the bag if you want.  It's the lack of having to have pots/pans/plates/etc that makes this interesting, I think.  And more expensive.<br /><br />It's only a good buy if it tastes good, and this tastes ... OK.  It's not like home-cooked eggs and bacon.  The texture is sort of spongy, and the bacon bits are more jerky like than crispy bacon.  But the flavors are quite good.  Not overly salty, tastes like eggs.<br /><br />The primary positives for this are the ease of packing for a hiking/camping adventure.  The packages weigh very little, and don't require you to pack other items normally needed for cooking/eating except a few forks/spoons, and a cup that can be used for measuring.  What's left when you're finished is a very light-weight pouch, again easily packed for disposal later.<br /><br />This IS pricey, though -- you're paying for the convenience of having a complete meal, including ""cooking"" and ""serving,"" self-contained in one easy-to-pack-and-dispose-of pouch.<br /><br />If you have the luxury of cooking equipment, there are tastier alternatives (I'm partial to the OvaEasy eggs -- great taste/texture, decent price).

"I have a bunch of different types of bottles that I use primarily for water and decaf iced tea, mostly made of various plastics. So I was very interested in trying something different.<br /><br />First, what's good about this:<br />-- it holds 25 oz -- that's a good amount, really<br />-- it fits in every cup holder in my Camry -- it's slim and stylish<br />-- it's made of stainless steel -- the only plastic is the cap and straw<br />-- it keeps cold drinks cold for a reasonable length of time -- it's not insulated, but I was surprised to find my drink still cold after 30 minutes<br />-- it's attractive -- tall, blue, with three depressions in each side that makes it easy to get a secure grip<br />-- It has a seal that is leak-proof. I really tried to get this thing to leak, and nothing I tried worked. This is a good thing.<br /><br />I use it primarily for decaf iced tea, filling it with ice first, and then pouring hot strong tea over the ice. Put on the lid, give it a few shakes, and it's ready to go. Do NOT consider this for hot coffee or hot tea. Remember, it's NOT insulated.<br /><br />What's not as good about this:<br />-- not dishwasher safe. That's what the instructions say -- I may try putting the metal bottle part in the dishwasher sometime, but I don't want to risk compromising the leak-proof seal. This is not a deal breaker for me. I just clean it in warm soapy water each night -- a quick slosh and rinse -- and it's ready to go the next morning.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a higher-quality bottle than I was expecting. It works great for my iced tea, is easy to hold and clean, and its slim profile makes it convenient to fit in some tight spaces.<br />(I was provided a sample of this product to test and evaluate.)",0.9919,433,39.36363636363637,0.0,2.29757
"I'm single, so I don't need a huge grill for everyday use.  I've been using a smaller Weber portable gas grill since 2006, and it's served me well, although it IS starting to show its age.  So I jumped at the opportunity to try out this Camco Portable Gas Grill.<br /><br />Where do I begin?  Let's start with the good stuff:<br /><br />1.  It comes FULLY ASSEMBLED.  All you have to do is unpack it, fold out the legs, attach a propane canister (you'll need to purchase one of those), and you're good to go.  Nothing could be easier.  My local supermarket sells the little propane canisters, and even has sales on them, so I usually pick up 2 or 3 when I can get them cheap and store them in a protected corner of my garage.<br /><br />2.  It's attractive.  OK, I know looks aren't everything, but it helps when something like this shows a bit of style and flair.  The stainless steel is quite nice, and easy to keep clean, too.<br /><br />3.  It actually has quite a lot of cooking space for a small grill.  No, you won't be able to feed a neighborhood, but of singles, couples, or small families, it should be fine.<br /><br />4.  It's easy to use.  Turn on the gas, press and hold the button until it lights.  You can adjust the flame with the little dial on the side near the gas attachment.  The built-in thermometer is actually fairly accurate (I checked it with a thermometer I use for other grilling, one tha tI know to be accurate), and it was accurate within 5-10 degrees.  That's good enough for me and the kinds of things I cook.<br /><br />5.  The storage bag is very nice, very well made, and even has a pouch for the gas canister.  Nice touch, that.<br /><br />Not so good stuff:<br /><br />1.  hmmmm ... can't really think of anything negative to say about this.  If you're planning to use it on something other than a metal surface, you may need to get a protective mat or something to go under it, but I'm not even sure that's necessary.  The temperature under the grill (in the space between grill and table) has never gotten very hot, even after running the grill for an hour or more.  I use mine on a folding table with a metal ""slats"" surface [[ASIN:B00CN099W0 RIO Adventure Roll-Top Table]], so I have nothing under it.  Tested it with my hand after cooking on it for an hour, and it seemed fine.<br /><br />So far, I've grilled steaks, burgers, brats, and chicken.  It got a good workout over Memorial Day weekend -- it was good weather and i grilled every day.  Absolutely no problems.  The slide-out grease tray is easy to remove and clean, too.<br /><br />This is a premium-quality small gas grill, well designed, well constructed, and attractive.

"This blanket is lite and is as warm as people say. But the two outsides are not sewn together to hold both sides with the insulation; so the blanket is shifting constantly. Also hard to distinguish underside from over, and they keep twisting. Could never even figure out head and foot from sides, under side from top side. This was a hassle since I am small and blanket is big. Was going to return, then thought how a footbox would help so much. Didn't want sew anything since I was thinking of returning. Just took strap off of compression bag and wrapped it around foot end. Not a true foot box. But gives me a place to start and does keep cover from slipping off feet. Now I really like it.

"I was an avid user of Sweet Sweat for the longest time and it was good. Until my trainer recommended me TC1.<br />Literally surprised i have never heard of this product before and if i did i would have used this from the start without a doubt.<br /><br />Its substance is a little bit thicker but thats okay you dont need a whole lot to apply. Its scent is also nice (if i were to describe it, smells sweet like fruity pebbles? but still good) Simply apply it as usual to the areas your gonna work out or need an extra sweat that day (Legs on leg day, lower/upper back on back days/chest on chest days/ Etc. etc. you get the gist)<br /><br />Within the first 10 minutes of walking on the treadmill.

"Pros and cons of the Burton Men's ember fleece glove:<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Excellent silicone grip on palm and two fingers<br />* Works reasonably well with touch screens (car, phone, etc.)<br />* Very good fit and feel, comfortable glove<br />* Very light weight, stays warm if you sweat a bit.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Good for say the 20-40 degree (farenheit) range<br /><br />Burton makes good gloves, and this is one is quite reasonably priced for what it is and does.  It is warmer than the gloves that really are almost liners, say two notches above that, the silicone grip is really effective, very easy to hold things, work a steering wheel, etc.  Rest of the glove is some sort of fleece, a bit like polartec, maybe heavier than 100, closer to 200 say, but generally warm.  Not totally wind proof, but close.  Sizing on me (Large) is about what I would expect, tight across the palm (but they loosen up), fingers a bit long (but mine run short), but not too long.  I could maybe do without the label on the back of the hand (or at least something smaller), but I suppose that is branding these days.

"[[VIDEOID:670390d5f4bbbcd1c8a0c687f3650946]] Let me start by saying that I am a person that does a lot of research before buying an item. I don't spend on a whim. It may take me weeks or a month before making that buying commitment. I look for something that has all the features I need.<br />  I was looking to replace my air Jordan sling that I've had for at least 15 years , maybe longer. First choice was another air Jordan but I could not get the same style..so I started hunting.<br />  This brand seemed to fit my needs. Had many of the same feature as my old backpack..and this has a bottle holder which my old one did not have. BONUS :) So I waited till prime day and got this for 10dollars cheaper . Oh ,and the reviews were decent .<br />  Well it arrived today and I couldn't be more disappointed. This is really small for my needs. Measurements on this are embellished. Reviews said this was great for a day trip or hike but honestly if you just wear a Tshirt and shorts you would be ok. I wanted to fit work clothes and my lunch in this bag but that isn't happening.<br />  There are many pockets but let's be honest, you can only fit so much inside this bag. Extra pockets don't give you more space, they provide just separation.<br />  We shall see how the durability of this is. No way it will give me 15 years as I'm pretty rough on my bag as it goes everywhere I go. It's hard letting go of a good pair of shoes or a bag or any fashion you have had for many years cause it's hard to replace something so durable. I'm sure many have had that experience.<br />  Overall this is just to small for my needs as you can see in the picture. The measurements are a stretch. Durability we will see and I will update.<br />1 WEEK later......no issues with the bag. I have been gentle as far as overstuffing it. The size issue is muy inconvenient. Many issues on that topic but just one......I work outdoors and head to work with a hoodie cause its chilly in the a.m. the hoodie wont fit in the bag when the weather warms and i only have a shirt, lunchbag, phone/charger, misc stuff already in it.. Reading the comments , This makes me curious what kind of day trip people are taking in order to use this bag in that fashion..",0.9885,498,23.714285714285715,0.4,1.2165500000000002

I thought a cheaper set would work as I am hardly ever here. These are the worst set of poles I have ever seen. I have given poles as gifts and was happy this pair was not one such set or I would have been embarrassed.<br />I had set the poles at home, to my desired length. At the lake, before I could even take a step, one kept collapsing at the bottom. I did not trek of road, due to this. I fixed the poles again and hoped they would stay but the bottom of the pole seems very flimsy. I decided to walk to road around the lake....cautiously, I have had a double knee replacement so I rely on the poles a bit more than I used to. The pole stayed fixed to my adjustment but the shock nechanism broke in one of the handles.<br />I have them and as I'm seldom at my mothers, and do not have the time to mess around with sending them back, I will keep them but I cannot recommend them at all and I am baffled by the high rating.<br />I know walking and trekking poles and these are awful. I guess you get what you pay for.<br />If you have had injuries to your knees I absolutely would not rely on them.<br />I was hoping to write a better review as I wanted to like them (though not being my primary poles my standard were low to begin with so I ordered the cheap set) but they are awful.<br /><br />Absolutely do not recommend these at all!",-0.9025,351,35.1,0.2,0.18925000000000003

The Fresh Taste one and Hydracentials (2 of those actually....old and new style)<br /><br />After 3 weeks of using them regularly, here is my experience.<br /><br />H2O<br />Started off great. I thought. I put ice in it and thought it stayed cold. This bottle was full of ice (ice goes in first...to the top), then water and then water flavoring and it is shaken up.<br /><br />Fresh Taste<br />It is used exclusively for kefir. I fill it up with ice. Add some kefir, a little water and perhaps a flavoring packet. Shake it up and it's ready to use.<br /><br />Hydracentials<br />The old bottle I gave to my mother who refuses to return it (which is fine....she's my mother lol). She loves it and I loved it before here.<br />The new bottle is different only slightly and is used exclusively for water. Again, I fill it up to the top with ice, then add water.<br /><br />After doing this several night (well nearly 3 weeks), here is what I found. I also did this at about 8pm this evening.<br /><br />The Hydracentials is very cold. Usually there is still ice in it in the morning and often until the next afternoon and evening.<br />The Fresh Taste is also very cold. There is always some ice in the kefir mixture and it's more than safe enough to drink.<br /><br />This brings me to the H2O bottle. At 8pm I filled all 3 bottles as usual. At 12:30am. This bottle had no ice left in it and it was somewhat warm. I thought it did better than that when I first got it but have actually comparison tested it for the last few days. It does not stay cold. I don't know what I could have done to it but I will actually need to toss it. It does not last as long as a Walmart thermos. In addition, the metal part rusts. Not much but I have not had for that long.<br /><br />Update<br />Used again today. I have not been paying much attention to it but went to pick it up and the bottle was sweating. The other two bottles were not. It has been sitting, like the other two bottles in a 75F room.

Once in a while on games I will take it out of the case (Contract Killer is one)but since getting the case, I have probably had it out of the case a total of 10 times.<br />Recently when on vacation, it was great because I didn't have to worry about the 2 year old, 3 year old, 4 year old and 5 year old in the family getting it and dropping it. I didn't feel the need to protect it like gold because I knew it was safe.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",0.9865,280,35.0,0.0,2.29595

I live (RB) RollerBlade skates because they’re wide. Perfect for my feet. I have a pair of hard shell skates that’s comfortable and give you a lot of ankle support for jumps and grinds but they’re heavy. These soft shell skate are fantastic! They’re comfortable and great for wide feet. They do support the ankle for casual skating. Not for jumping because it doesn’t have shock absorbers in the heel area. The wheels are fantastic for beginners because they’re soft wheels at 82A. To make this skate more advanced switch out the bearings and wheels. Don’t listen to the people with bad reviews but this affordable skate if you’re just using it for casual skating meaning no jumps or tricks. Yes wheels wear down if you use them to stop.

"I have no doubt that this item is amazing considering all the other reviews I’ve read about it. That alone made me jump at the chance to order myself two cans. I intended to immediately open one to use right now and then save the other one to use later on and purchase more depending upon how well my family liked the can we opened. Here’s where I should have paid more attention to the comments in the reviews but didn’t, and it was a mistake to overlook this. I too, found out that I’m unable to get one of these cans opened up with any of the can openers that I currently own.<br />Upon further investigation I went to the manufacturer’s website and they suggested that in order to open up one of these cans you should use an industrial sized can opener or one claiming to be heavy duty!<br />No where on this item description do they bother to let customers know this in advance of making a purchase! So now I suppose I’m expected to also make a purchase for an appropriate type can opener so that I can enjoy the item I’ve already purchased.<br />Just FYI, if you don’t own the appropriate type opener, toss it in with your order for this or you can just plan on sitting this can aside. The lid sits down too low for a regular can opener to reach it in order to make a cut.<br />I won’t take away from the product when this information should have been disclosed by the seller, Amazon in order to inform the customers about the product they’re buying beforehand.<br />*****<br />Update ***My Son worked at opening this can with the can opener that I already owned and that I had been trying to use. He finally managed to get it opened but he had a mess with lots of loose slivers from the steel can that we had to be very careful about not getting mixed in with the strawberries. We used tape to catch the slivers and then wrapped the edge of the can with the tape so we could dump the strawberries into a large ziplock bag.<br />My can was more than 3/4 full and the strawberries are amazing, just as others have mentioned. We made a strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting and tossed in some of these strawberries to bake in the cake mix and it was delicious!<br />This is a wonderful purchase with the exception of having difficulty opening the can. A heavy duty can opener or access to a commercial can opener would be very helpful. Maybe a school or senior center would open the can for you if asked or a restaurant owner.",0.9321,536,44.66666666666666,0.6,2.45963

"I was a little cautious to try this bit at first, being so different from usual and a little on the thin side. But after trying it on a few horses it's become one of my go-to bit (and I'm pretty particular). The joints give it a nice amount of play and provide some tongue relief. The greenies really seem to like it and it's been great for introducing horses to contact. They get a nice firm feel they can trust, and the fact the sides can move independently give them an introduction to a the greater independent movement they'll experience from more mobile bit (like double joints).<br /><br />Far from being too thin, I find the bits fit horses' bars much better than, say, a rubber bit or happy mouth, which are often either too thick to be comfortable or just too much bulk in a green horse's mouth. There's enough bulk for the horse to feel and trust, but it's thin enough that if you need control it's there - unlike a rubber bit. I was concerned the joints might pinch but I haven't seen any sign of horses acting like it does. And it's surprisingly flexible, curving into a nice C shape which again has a clear limit the horse can trust when introducing contact.<br /><br />The D rings help the but from sliding as well as make turning cues more understandable - when turning the opposite side D pushes on their lips to bring the head around, it's not just pressure on the inside bar.<br /><br />I've been entirely thrilled with the response from this bit, and it's my new go-to greeny bit. Every horse I've put it in seems to really like it and I've seen dramatic improvements in contact over too-remedial rubber/plastic bits, and too advanced highly mobile bits. Also an excellent choice for horses who like a quiet bit, or a rider with noisy hands.  My horses have given me light and amazingly consistent contact - the only horse I'd recommend against using this bit on is one who wants to be extremely heavy in the contact by leaning on the hand (usually this begins from rider error btw),  who prefers a bit with a lot one movement of play, or one with a bull-neck who locks against the bit (I think you could still handle that in this bit if the rider is comfortable).<br /><br />Anyways I love this bit and highly recommend it for greenies or restarts with mouth issues. I plan to buy another one or two in the future.",0.9991,511,42.583333333333336,0.1,2.3297299999999996
"Good quality bit, but make sure you understand how the fulmer differs from a regular fullcheek before buying it. As a fulmer should be, it's VERY heavy. VERY HEAVY. The action of this bit is best suited to the French style of riding, where the bit is lifted to act on the corners of the mouth - unlike a full cheek which acts on the tongue and bars by pulling directly back. A Fulmer shouldn't be used with bit keepers, which will cause it to &#34;nutcracker&#34; into the horse's soft pallet. Also, it SHOULD be single jointed so the lifting action it folds forward (instead of up into the soft palette).<br /><br />Great bit for the price, just make sure you know what you're getting and how to use it. It's not just a different kind of fullcheek, it's a very different (and very heavy!) bit.",0.9665,187,23.375,0.0,2.28995
"Made from thin nylon and lightweight hardware and overall very cheapo feeling. Obviously a mini isn't as strong as a big horse, but I wouldn't ever consider putting a halter of this quality on a bigger horse/pony....  as it stands we'll see how they holds up with the minis. Be cautious using this with a rowdy mini or one that really fights/pulls, especially when tied.<br /><br />What everyone says about the sizing is true, I ordered 2 Larges and they are VERY SMALL, even for mini halters!!! If you have a large mini or one with a big head I would NOT recommend these halters. The noseband especially is quite small (even adjusted big as it goes) and probably wouldn't fit a mini with a big nose, or may prevent them opening their mouth. Unless I had a very small foal I wouldn't risk getting anything but the large, especially since you can adjust the halters smaller with the slip adjusters if needed. The noseband at its largest is about 20&#34; around and the cheek pieces are about 4&#34; long (trust me, that's smaller than it sounds).<br /><br />For now I'm giving it 4 stars because it's fair enough for less than $6.50 (I'd be upset if I paid more). And I do like that in addition to the normal crown strap it has 2 extra places to adjust it, slip-type adjustments under the jaw and throatlash. These might be great for getting a better fit, but they seem like they might slip under pressure (like pulling back) or just over time, and if something is gonna break it'll probably be these. The little grab-staps are a nice addition and a good length at about 8&#34; long. They have a loop at one end that the rest of the lead slips through so it's easy to take them off without the need to cut anything. I'm taking them off for the minis but they'd be handy if needed and I might use them on another horse in the future, since they could go on any halter.<br /><br />Overall fine for the price but definitely on the low end of the quality spectrum. Probably fine for light normal use but I wouldn't trust it with a strong mini or a puller. Definitely order larger than you think you'll need! I'll update my review if needed after using them for a while.",0.9938,489,32.6,1.2,2.25814
"Beautiful, well made spurs. Quality construction and I like how tightly everything fits together-- obviously there's attention paid to precise engineering and manufacture. They look like they cost way more than they did!<br /><br />The surface which contacts the horse is nice and smooth, and the pieces which hold the spur balls are placed in a way that makes it unlikely they'll catch the horse and create cuts or rubs (or just be uncomfortable!). I personally believe spurs should only be used sparingly and only by riders with an educated, still leg. Spurs allow leg cues to be smaller and more refined, they're not for banging on the horse, punishing the horse, or bullying the horse. Because of this I prefer rounded, small spurs with no sharp edges. These are absolutely perfect.",0.7831,161,23.0,0.5,2.3849299999999998
"Unfortunately I'll be returning this item as it's HUGELY oversized. I bought the horse size hoping it'd be fairly standard and could adjust up or down for use on a variety of types of horses, but I think it'd be roomy even on a draft. Obviously every brand is slightly different in sizing, but there's absolutely no way this could ever be called &#34;horse size&#34;, or even &#34;warmblood size&#34;. One of the main horses I'd hoped to use this on is an 18.1hh cyldesdale-cross who would happily fit into even most draft-sized tack, yet there was no way to make this work for him.  Even punching holes wouldn't have fixed the size issue, as it would have required the cheek buckles to sit ABOVE the brow-band. It's seriously HUGE.<br /><br />Three stars, because the quality is actually pretty good-- I'd have given 4 if it were just &#34;bigger than normal&#34; instead of &#34;pachyderm sized&#34; and absolutely unworkable. Anyone purchasing this should order a full two sizes below what they normally order-- pony size for a horse, possibly cob sized for a heavy warmblood. The leather and hardware quality is impressive and very acceptable for the price point. I really appreciated it has a jaw strap to keep the cheek pieces from being pulled into the eyes (as a lungeing cavesson should have) as opposed to a throatlash like you see on most cheapo cavessons. A throatlash can't be tight enough to prevent slipping AND loose enough to not restrict the windpipe.  My only gripe with the construction would be that because the brass nose-piece is so heavy (as it should be), the chinstrap needs to be adjusted quite firmly too keep it from being pulled around or slipping to the side-- however the chin strap isn't sufficiently padded for this, and really requires a channel pad to be safely tight enough while still being comfortable for the horse.",0.9913,395,35.90909090909091,0.8,1.7373900000000002
"Received this today and I was really shocked how big the bag was! I got lots of nice, good-sized pieces-- but seriously, everybody who's getting cranky needs to remember this a bag of SCRAPS.

"I was seriously impressed with the quality and expensive look of this pack. I love love love the purple and it looks like something from a top-brand fitness line.

It's got lots of pockets (a main one, 2 on the front, and a zip pocket on the back) but really only the main one is usable. The other 3 pockets could maybe fit a chapstick or a key (but not my key RING, with several keys and a fob and charm), and would be much more useful if they turned the front 2 pockets into one medium sized one. The main pocket can fit a cellphone, but snugly and without room for much more, not even a wallet. I use this to carry a couple small items around when I don't need much on me and for have pockets, but it's not suitable as a day pack or if you need to carry more than a few small items.<br /><br />I get plenty of use out of it, LOVE the look, like the quality.... wish the design were better. It's one of those things that's going to be useful for some and absolutely a waste of time for others. I reckon it'd be excellent for jogging. I recommend this product, just make sure you know the size will work for you before you get it.",0.9956,368,36.8,0.0,1.8986800000000001
"Handy little monkey strap, can also be used to keep stirrups up while lunging, or to carry your saddle more easily (how I usually use it), and many other creative uses. It's well made and durable, and the snaps make it really convenient to pop on and off or repurpose quickly. I like the webbing material as well-- it's definitely not as classy looking as leather, but it's easy to clean and I don't have to worry about it getting scratched or bent out of shape, or marking other leather pieces. Very handy thing to have around, and I actually feel better having it on my saddle because I reckon I could use it for a lot of different things if I got in a pinch while out riding. I end up getting a lot more use out of this than leather grab straps just because of the snaps and the durability. Would buy again.",0.9645,175,29.166666666666668,0.4,2.40935
"Don't waste your money. Run far far away from this horrible, horrible piece of garbage. The whole thing is made of thick, bulky, cheap, SLIPPERY junk material that has no business being around horses. Not only is the lead too bulky and slick to *safely* hold on to (seriously, it's dangerous-- it'll slip through your hands and cause severe burns), but the darn halter is too slippery to stay even tied! I know how to tie a rope halter correctly (knot goes on the bottom/back, not top/front) and there's no WAY that should slip, never in my life had another halter slip like that even with a big ornery horse tied solid-- yet this joke of a halter I had to tighten up every few steps while leading a yearling pony! God's honest truth, every few steps. I hate this thing, viscerally, from deep down in my being I loathe it, with every fiber.<br /><br />This halter/lead is literally dangerous and an accident waiting to happen on several levels, and it shouldn't be on the market. It's garbage, and the absolute worst piece of equipment I've ever bought. I halfway wonder if it's not some Chinese fake, as I can't believe any actual tack company would green-light this piece of junk.

"I'm a professional trainer and about 6 weeks ago I got whapped in the head by a metal stirrup, splitting my forehead open, knocking me unconscious, and concussing me-- not fun. It was one of those freak things you know COULD happen, but never really happens.... until it does. I've got many saddles and only one had composite stirrups, so now I'm replacing all my metal stirrups, for safety. And hey-- they make your saddle so much lighter! I decided to try one set of these and see if I'd use them on all my saddles-- the pair of composite stirrups I have, which I love, were from New Zealand, or else I'd have bought 6 pairs of them.<br /><br />These stirrups definitely do the job and are among the cheapest, if not THE cheapest. They're light enough, but not as light as ideal. The manufacturing is a little rough, with a slightly sloppy seam all around. After comparing them to my other  composite stirrups, I personally prefer the wider foot bed on my other pair, since they give more gripping area. I'll keep and use these stirrups and I'd recommend them for someone on a budget, but I might try another brand next time just out of curiosity.",0.9656,252,28.0,0.3,1.97968

"I was going to return it after fumbling with it for the first 3 minutes.  What happened was that when I put the batteries in and clicked it on, the light out-put seemed about 50 lumens like a cheap $1.50 harbor freight light.  I switched batteries -- no luck.  I thought I had been &#34;HAD&#34;.  When I read the instructions I realized there was a toggle switch on the front part of the flashlight that controlled brightness.  So as I clicked through the settings and it was increasingly brighter each step.  I took it outside at night and was impressed on the highest settings.  It remembers your chosen last light level so if you click it off on high, then click it back on ... it will be on &#34;high&#34;.  Do I think it's 1000 lumens?  Probably not.  I think it barely beats my SureFire M600 Ultra Scout Ultra-High Output LED Weapon Light with 500 lumens ($300).  The Surefire I think has a more concentrated cone, whereas the Nitecore has a little more peripheral throw to it.  It's not as clear/focused as the surefire, maybe 5-10% less.  I like the contact switch option because it gives you the best of both worlds, you can momentarily activate the light and there is another separate button on the light itself where you can toggle the light on or off.  Once again, the last mode you switched off with is remembered.  So I like this feature better than the Surefire.  Some of these tactical lights cycle through strobe, brightness levels when you hit the momentary contact switch --- utter junkola.  I will agree with other reviewers, the mount is ... sub-par, but  that is easily remedied with the purchase of a better mount.  I don't think the housing is as tough as the surefire, but it doesn't weigh as much either of course...important if you are Buck-Rogering out your rifle, it gets heavy fast.  Actually I bought this to put on an Air Rifle to do some night time varmit hunting with, but I may end up moving it to one of my more utilized carbines.

This should be a must in all bug out bags and in your car.  Gently squeeze the plastic tab and press down slowly and firmly to shave off some flint material into your fire media.  A couple of times is enough.  Then squeeze hard and press fast to generate a flood of sparks.  The sparks will in turn ignite the shaven media and the heat will burst your fire media into flames.

It sits about 3/4""-1"" off ground & is so,so smooth. I have freestyle , fast ultra rocker LBs , I have cruiser / slide decks & even downhill speed decks but when I seek chill, slow, very fast , controlled cruises, I pull this badboy out. I weigh 155lbs so I chose blood orange barrel 80street-side & a venom 90 tall barrel deck-side w flat washers; allows max turn for a very non-turny type board. Worth every dime. Highly recommended if you're near 6' tall and over 140#s.  Comparable to a Landyachtz Switch40 Tiger but I use no riser so a tad lower.

"Excellent price point for what it is. There are no instructions but the diagram was easy enough to figure out.<br /><br />The main problem is the piston overheats with prolonged use and as it heats up, resistance lessens. This means you cannot do an intense 30 minute workout in one sitting, you have to do sets, rest in between, and then do more sets. I'm in no rush, so I can do this, but you should be aware if you buy this.<br /><br />Also, the highest level of resistance doesn't feel like rowing through actual water. It's not particularly challenging. You feel it once you are many reps in, so it still works if you go by volume of strokes. But, again, see above for the overheating issue.<br /><br />Still, if you break the workout into sets of 10 minutes and have maybe 5 minutes of rest time in between, getting 30 minutes of rowing time and 15 minutes of rest still works for me. I'd buy something better for the next machine, but this is a good start.",0.4517,226,28.25,0.1,1.7655100000000001
"This kama looks nothing like that in the picture, although its dimensions are correct.<br /><br />The seller did not indicate that the kama would be unsharpened...and it is going to take A LOT to sharpen this due to the thickness of the steel. The kama blade is also set in the handle, not on top of the handle, and the blade is single-pegged, with a flimsy-looking method, not traditionally double pegged, and it does NOT have a tang that extends down into the handle as the picture would suggest, since the blade is attached to the handle in an entirely different manner than depicted....<br /><br />Although the materials seem sturdy, the construction does not seem to make it suitable for real use.<br /><br />Buy this only if you want an unsharpened practice kama. Seller really needs to update the picture.<br /><br />Edit: Also, the packaging was falling apart upon arrival. Almost two inches of the tip of one kama was sticking out and some of the paper was torn. Needs to be packaged better, but at least it was still undamaged, which proves the materials are suitably sturdy. I don't know if it will stand up to a real impact, though.<br /><br />EDIT: One kama blade rotated today (the peg loosened and it flipped out to the top of the handle).

"It's designed to cut on both sides so you don't have to worry about how it lays of the top of a limb.  At 48"",  you can use long strokes. It does not come with a rope, but it's probably better to pick the rope you want, rather than using some cheap  poly rope that typically comes with these.<br /><br />Rope saws do work pretty well, but they're a lot of work. It takes some time and quite a bit of effort,  pulling back and forth on your ropes. Hardwoods like Oak, will take a while. A four inch Oak limb, 30 feet in the air will tire you out but because of the improved design features, it will be easier than older designs.  It beats climbing way up into trees and hanging from ropes with a chainsaw in your hands!<br /><br />It's a fairly simple concept that works.

"This is an excellent machine!  The movement is extremely smooth and, to my great surprise, completely SILENT.  The only thing that might be a deterrent to some is the level of resistance.  I started out using it only on level 1, because I primarily wanted to burn calories.  However, when I decided to bump up the tension to increase my workout, I noticed that there is very little difference in the tension between level 1 and level 8 (the highest this machine will go).<br />Therefore, if you are really looking for a good workout, I don't think a machine like this is for you.  I personally plan on bumping up the workout I get with this machine by threading one of those bungy exercise ropes through the carry handle to work out my upper body at the same time (got the idea from another product I saw advertised on TV).  If you are one of those, like me, that doesn't get a lot of exercise, this machine is a nice option which is significantly cheaper than an actual recumbent exercise bike.

"First of all, this mattress is extremely comfortable and probably the most comfortable I've ever had in my entire life.

To be clear, only one person was sleeping on it, so it was far below the weight limit, but after a very short time, the first 2 mattresses failed and completely flattened and couldn't be reinflated.  This happened without any ""warning"" and both times I was woken up in the middle of the night with the mattress completely deflated.  The company promptly replaced it a 2nd time, but this 3rd mattress is by far the worst and doesn't hold air at all.

"Neat. Choose your size wisely. I opted for size Large, and it measures the same as what the product description states. I opted for the large size because my wrists are just at 7"", and I figured since this is going to be also further up my arm, then I will want the added wiggle room. Also says can be used on ankle, but I wont be using it that way. If it feels loose at the wrist, then pull it up to be situated further up the forearm. If it is still too loose, then you simply got the wrong size. Try a small.<br /><br />Has some stretch, isnt too big. Super lightweight. Has a zipper at one end, as well as a slit pocket. Can be worn facing out or facing in depending on what you are carrying.<br /><br />I didnt get it for carrying my phone. I have a large smart phone (pixel 6xl) and while this fits, it is awkward  as expected. The description mentions a small phone, and they dont stress this as a phone carrier, just as an option.<br /><br />I actually got it for 2 things. I work a physical job and dont take regular breaks or lunches. I take supplements on the fly and like the idea of having somewhere to stow them. I rarely wear anything with pockets. I can easily keep a bandaid, lip gloss, electrolyte powder packet, other small items that I may want to have on me. This feels no different than a shirt sleeve. But the other way I plan to use it, and reason for ordering it is for security of money or credit cards. Nice way to carry something like that when I dont want to be carrying it in a purse. Reminds me of any number of travel items out there that are created for this purpose. So instead of a bra purse or a belt or ankle hidey garment, this little sleeve feels all the more natural and easier to access. I like it.<br /><br />I can see using this for the gym, especially places that have an ID card. Just tuck the card and my locker key inside then go do my workout.<br /><br />I imagine there are other uses.",0.9732,457,19.041666666666668,0.0,1.89196
"Key ring with camo strap and lightweight carabiner clip. Don't go mountain climbing with this, but if you simply want a tacti-cool key chain, or a way to attach a water bottle to a hiking bag etc, then this will work out just fine.

Just as something to attach other small bags, flashlights,  water bottle, whatever. Exterior clips are always welcome as a means of convenience. These are on par with other items I have purchased over the years.<br /><br />5 stars. Not necessarily because they are better than other products, but because they meet my expectations.

"Gentle warmth that is most noticeable when paired with shoes, slippers, or another pair of socks. Not because these socks aren't thick enough but because the heat is better trapped with an additional layer. Same goes with electric toss/throws. I find it best to have a blanket over the heated blanket. Same with heated vests. But with these socks, it is almost imperative to do so.<br /><br />The socks themselves are actually quite nice, and the little pocket could be used to stash something if you didnt want to use the battery packs. So not a total loss if you end up not liking these.<br /><br />Says fits US size 6-14. They dont indicate if they are referring to men or women sizing. I will assume mens sizing. I have size 10/11 womens feet which is size 8/9 mens feet. These fit fine with plenty of stretch to spare.<br /><br />Easy to use. Just charge the battery packs. Comes with a USB that splinters into 2 smaller USBs.<br /><br />Flashes while charging. Then when you want to put them in socks, just plug into the cord in each sock. Press to turn on, presse to scroll through to High, Medium, or Low heat.  The lower the heat the longer the battery charge life.<br /><br />Overall I think chemical warmers are the way to go. No need to charge or worry about them petering out. But the heated socks have been something I wanted to try for a long time. They aren't amazing, but they aren't a disappointment either. Feels good on extra cold days, feels perfect for my Raynauds Syndrome. Helps keep feet at constant temperature. High feels great, but low is actually best for me as I dont need hot heat.<br /><br />I would say hand wash, and definitely dont put in dryer.",0.9919,383,17.40909090909091,0.1,1.92757

It is really quite nice.<br /><br />The flip top cam snaps closed, and has additional locking mechanism to keep the top from opening.<br /><br />Appears to have a silicon pop out in the lid. I think that can be drank from, but I find it awkward. I thought that could be a possible breach spot in terms of leakage, but the silicone stays in place securely when in closed cap position.<br /><br />The main drinking ports are from the internally attached straw where you draw from the lip of the cap, or you can tilt back and pour into mouth. It's a different design! But it works. Just took me a little while to get used to it.<br /><br />I like a variety of water bottles. I have all sorts of sizes and capacities. I have ones much larger than this. This style isnt my daily drinker, but I like the large bottles for taking with me in the car. I like having something on me in case of emergency that is always fresh. Or I pack up several of these bottles for when I am off doing outdoor labor work. I dont hike too often with this size bottle, but I do like having ones that can be carried in hand via wrist strap or whatever, and be able to hold a few extra goodies.

"Some Augason Farms stuff I buy as emergency food, some I buy for regular use. If I can price out something in this form that is same price or less than other forms, then I go with this as it can be stored away or kept in my working pantry. I use a lot of Augason Farms, and I've been pleased with this.<br /><br />Dehydrated celery is a great addition to the pantry. Sometimes I dont have fresh, or I have fresh that went bad, or I dont find it in the store, or what is there looks bad, or price is way outside my budget. Having some dried celery tucked away in my pantry really helps stretch the budget and brings value to my time.<br /><br />I keep the recipe trifecta on hand, ""mire poix"": celery, carrot, and onion. I keep fresh, frozen, and dried on hand. Usually used in recipes that will help rehydrate these foods no problem. Celery is very easy to rehydrate. I usually just add to the cooking process and its good to go.<br /><br />Food scarcity is legit, so if you can stock up when items are on sale, then I recommend to do so. Consider it insurance.<br /><br />FYI: food and such are sold based on weight, not volume. There is 1lb, 2 oz packed in this #10 can (that reads, ""number ten"" not ""ten pound""- it is a size of can). Using a #10 can means that it provides uniformity among storage. Emergency supplies are packed for long term and are packed to stack. They also float. They can be repurposed. Even if one gets a dent, contents are still good (unless and actual hole, which is not likely to happen). The food will not be filled to the brim, and also.. food settles after packing.",0.9786,386,22.705882352941178,1.2,2.65358
"Good! I bought a couple of #10 (number ten) cans on sale. The price was reasonable enough to use one right away. Usually if I am purchasing emergency packaged items, I will tuck them away for.. emergency, for a later time. But occasionally a pretty good sale rolls through that makes it as good as or better than a non emergency packed food item.<br /><br />I like these shreds- makes for a tasty side dish, they rehydrate well, and are just super easy to work with. I tend to like Augason Farms products, and keep a wide assortment in my long term pantry. Nice way to build up stock, a sense of reassurance. Buy what you can while you can. Look for sales, buy a little extra here and there. Don't be without food. Don't pay more than you have to. If the price looks good now, just go for it.",0.9913,184,15.333333333333334,1.1,2.62739
"Buy what you can, when you can. Of all the emergency branded supplies I have, tomato powder is one my must have products. It has good nutrients and can be used for so many applications and takes up little space. I buy when on sale, and I also buy non emergency packed tomato powders as I really like it that much. One note about tomato powders- they tend to clump. All freeze dried tomato products that aren't loaded with preservatives and anti-caking agents will have clumped balls. This does not make it a bad product or an unusable product. It will dissolve in liquid. It is not an issue. I mention this because I see others mentioning it as a bad thing. It is really not a thing, at all. Oxygen absorber may not do a darn thing. Really, it isnt an issue to spend energy over. But, when I go to open this can, I will likely portion the contents into smaller mylar pouches or vac seal in a mason jar as the large #10 (number ten) will take awhile to work through. Little goes a long way.<br /><br />I like Augason Farms, I buy from them regularly. I tend to watch for sales as I am really just fleshing out my long term pantry rather than relying on it. I try to buy a few extra goods every time I am at the store, and I try to pick up an emergency packed item when it is on sale as I tend to just tuck it away and forget about it. Though occasionally something emergency packed will be cheaper than a regular non-emergency packed item, and I will buy it then (which then gives me opportunity to try it out).",-0.4471,333,18.5,1.1,2.1958699999999998
"Whatever, buy what you can while you can. Prices going up and up, availability will go down. Buy extra every time when at store. If you are at a spot where buying emergency marketed foods are within your budget, then by all means do so. Tuck it away. Todays cost will be more than paid for come tomorrow, ya know?<br /><br />Go for what you like to eat, go for variety. If you are deciding between vegetables, peas are nice way to go because they offer more nutrients (esp protein) over some options (such as corn). I pretty much only grab emergency food when it is on sale. I often just tuck it away and forget it. But I will occasionally buy it and use it if it happens to be cheaper than a non emergency packed food that I use regularly.<br /><br />I like Augason Farms quality and for the most part pricing. They have quite an assortment. I typicalluy buy the #10 cans (number ten) for stack ability, uniformity, readability, and ease of getting into (just a regular can opener). They float, they are durable, and I am not worried about dents (not same as a wet food product).",0.8602,251,19.307692307692307,0.9,2.52806
"Get what you can, while you can. Spend now, or spend even more later (and that is if food is available). Doesn't need to be emergency packed food. Buy extra of what you like to eat every single time you are at the store, shop sales, go frequently (don't wipe out shelves). If you are at a spot where you want to add greater variety to put into long term storage, then Augason tends to have quality products and better prices than other emergency brands. Look for their sales, shop often, build up your supplies.<br /><br />I like adding blueberries into the mix as it reconstitutes well, has good flavor and texture, and is still loaded with nutrients. Easy enough to stock up on rice and beans, harder to stock up on fruits and vegetables. Grow what you can, freeze or can what you can.. and buy what you can. Freeze dried is a very nice way to get good food that is still nutritious.<br /><br />Most  #10 (that reads, ""number ten"" not ten pound) cans will maintain freshness and quality for 10-25 years after production date. If opened, it will be shorter; depends on what you get. Blueberries in my experience are perfectly fine for a long time. Environmental factors will impact this. The cans are pest proof, can take a beating (even if dented should be fine as foods are freeze dried and have no moisture to sustain bacterial growth), can float if not opened, and are a standard size for stacking and uniformity (hence why weights will vary, and some stuff only fills a little of can).",0.9735,331,25.46153846153846,0.6,2.4720500000000003
"Lid is on tightly and securely as expected. I buy from Augason Farms when on sale, and slowly build up my stock. Even when not on sale, I tend to find that this company often has the best prices. I normally dont have any issues with regular bags of beans just left in a storage cupboard, but I wanted to start adding in some emergency packaged supplies. Kind of a buy it and forget it. More as insurance than anything. Yet sometimes I find stuff from Augason that is less expensive than a similar product that isnt packaged for long term storage. I wouldnt say this fell into that category, but really close to it (when on sale).<br /><br />I like black beans (and lentils) because they are incredible versatile and can really bulk up a meal, and can easily be a meat (like beef crumbles) replacement if need be. Or can be swapped in a little to help reduce the cost of a meat based meal. I recommend experimenting with cooking with foods you plan to store so it isnt a complete mystery on what to do with it once the need arises. At the very least, get a few good solid easy recipes down, and then figure out ways to get creative. Definitely learn to make a loaf, burger, balls with beans (or lentils). Will definitely give a satisfying mouth feel if used to eating meat.<br /><br />If you think you will be eating a lot of beans in the future, might want to add it in on a regular basis now to let the body get used to beans (gas, cramps, etc from sudden increase in bean consumption)<br /><br />Plain, uncooked beans will need to be soaked and/or cooked for a long period of time to become soft and edible. The same as buying a bag of dry beans at the store.<br /><br />I may be a little more picky on my food source and country of origin etc when buying my day to day foods, but when it comes to emergency supplies, I am more concerned with simply having something to fill my gut. I am paying for calories, plain and simple. I am paying for a variety of calories. I am paying for calories that I can rely on (ie well packaged). I have no problem with Augason Farms products, and am happy to be adding to my reserves.",0.9938,480,26.666666666666668,1.0,2.59814
"Geared toward kids, yet anyone can benefit from it. Both the lantern and the headlamp come with preinstalled AA batteries, and CR2032 respectively. There is a spot in the description where it says ""not included"" but they are, and another that said they are. They are, can confirm.  Just pull the little battery saver tab to activate. To access the battery compartment, you will need a tiny Phillips head screwdriver.  Flat works too.<br /><br />Both items are well made and durable feeling. I got that impression while unboxing. It just has a good feel, not cheap feeling. My video and pics are taken in a small dark storage room. Not actually producing colors.<br /><br />The HEAD LAMP band is stretchy and adjustable. I was able to slide it onto y large 23.75"" head. It is not something all that practical--no way to direct the light like one would with an adult sized head lamp but it is still useful. Good way to keep track of kid in darkness (camping, Halloween, emergency). It imparts a decent amount of direct light. I would even keep this in my car as a little emergency light. I could probably use this as a reading light if I wore it on my neck. Maybe.<br /><br />TO OPERATE: press yellow button on top. THIS could be tricky for some kids and adults. As the pressure point location is directly in the convex center. Cant just press any spot on the yellow surface. Must be directly between eyes. Once that is figured out, then it is super easy.<br /><br />The LANTERN is lightweight, yet robust feeling. Has TWO light options: top flashlight, forward direction. OR a diffuse lower lantern light. I think it lights up well enough for the space around. I am not sure why we would need to give a kid a spotlight (I just imagine little kiddos trying to blind others, This wont do that). This light is perfectly fine for them--in a tent, around their little area in an emergency, as their own bed side flashlight or night light of the sorts. I would use this myself in car, for sitting outside in evening, for light glow while walking around with dogs, or on my own, etc. I carry strong mag lights, but I find this little pack useful. Nice handle. Can be popped off if need be. Good base- wont easily tip over. Can take a drop to the ground, I think. Could hook this to a backpack and have lead adult or older kiddo to light up a path.<br /><br />TO OPERATE:  very easy, very intuitive, easy to press single button. Press to turn on upper flashlight, press again to switch it to the lantern. Another press simply turns it off.<br /><br />I see they have an owl option and I love owls. My only choice was a frog. Frogs are cool, but owls are my love. I like this lantern enough to want to buy the owl for myself. I plan to keep the headlamp in my bag, and the lantern will just set out. I figured if the power goes out, it can't hurt to have extra options that don't require me to hold onto it. I can keep this on one of my end tables, and just press the button. Then I can use it to go get other supplies and such. Will make for a good glow, enough to light up area enough to be comfortable to maneuver.<br /><br />----->>>>>>>In summary: This is a great little set. Fun looking, nice lights, COMES WITH BATTERIES INSTALLED, stretchy headband not limited to child use, good material, good feel, and is just refreshingly NICE product. Not cruddy feeling or looking. I do not rate on price, but I thought the full price reasonable. I bought the second one on sale (Prime Day), which was even better!<br /><br />I recommend this for kids, for adults who still enjoy kid like stuff, for gift giving (I'll for practical gifts, and for a kid this would be fun and practical). They did well with including pre-installed batteries (just pull-out battery saver tag--if it doesn't fully come out, you will need to go in and take it out).",0.9991,888,17.76,0.0,2.29973
"--->>>Cooked, freeze dried chicken in a #10 (ie ""number ten"") can. Just under 1 lb of chicken. Can eat as is, or rehydrate. Mix of chunks, shreds, and powder. Best use is as a compliment to a dish, rather than as the focus of a plate. Think chicken tacos, soups, casseroles.. stuff like that. Might be ok made into a chicken salad sandwich. Smells like chicken, tastes like chicken. Is on par with other freeze dried chicken. It is no worse than other brands, might be better than some I had. If price looks good to you, and you want a trusted brand, then this ReadyWise freeze dried chicken will be a welcome addition to your food supplies.<br /><br />I do not rate on price, if I did then I would be rating low. $120 is steep. Prices fluctuate, we all have different budgets, needs, preferences. And current market for emergency food is volatile. I am a bit of a prepper, and I do include emergency packaged products into my long-term storage. I am keenly aware of price fluctuations and that some brands are simply marked at a premium price. ReadyWise is definitely one of them, by far. Nearly double in some comparisons. A more budget friendly option is Augason. Just need to shop around. I can say that this is quality chicken, quality brand, and the extra may be worth it.  So with this review I will focus on quality, and include some ramblings regarding filling out your pantry and why, Things to think about.<br /><br />I really don't focus on ""emergency"" packed foods. I buy my usual canned/boxed/bagged foods a little at a time, and rotate. I stack my fridge and freezer. I should learn to can and prep my own foods better.  In more recent times I have been adding in emergency packed products but usually only when they are on sale.  Always been a bit of a ""prepper"", since I was a toddler it seems, haha. It has served me well through power outages, sicknesses, unemployment, and even bigger stuff like the pandemic, and now... *vaguely gestures around* everything else that is going on. Prices are all over the place, sometimes food isnt available (many times this year I have gone to a store and they have been 100% out of basic chicken, and I am not about to drive all over to find chicken, waste gas time money.. ). I've never been one to be without when anything has come up. I never did ""emergency food"" if only because I didn't have the budget. I would stick with typical foods and try to store them well. Well now I have a little more wiggle room in my budget, and with the on and off sales of long term storage (20+ years), I take advantage when I can. This ReadyWise is really expensive at $120 per can, AND it has a best buy date of only a few years out. It really should have at least 10 years, and upwards of 25. It is packed the same as other emergency food brands, so I would think that this too should be fine for the duration. UNLESS they mean once opened.. then yeh, I can understand that shorter date. Either way, its all fine by me (when stored under proper conditions food like this should last forever).<br /><br />I've been adding in emergency packed items to further shore up my options. Chicken is versatile, and I can share some with my dogs and cats if need be (don't forget to prep for them too!). I like buying the #10 cans and tucking them away. Forgetting about them. They stack well, have a uniform appearance, and if they are anything like other brands, the #10 cans should float. I don't live in a flood zone, but these should stand up to water, even with denting. Just remember, all food products are sold based on weight, not volume. Expect to see a half empty can on many foods. Most companies don't do different sized cans because of the preference for uniformity. I tend to see #10 cans, small buckets, large buckets, and the occasional barrel. They all stack.<br /><br />Does the term prepper freak you out? Everyone's SHTF scenario varies. Doesn't need to be doomsday. I have lived through enough and experience enough that I am always grateful for a little PROACTIVE thinking. Has gotten me through A LOT. It could be bad weather (tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms), could be illness (simple headache to viral and beyond), could be road trip gone wrong (you do keep supplies in your car too, right?!), could be unemployment, sky rocketing prices (yesterday's prices is money in my pocket today) or power outage, or lack of transportation, or oven/fridge/other appliance break down, lock downs, or bigger stuff like plagues, food shortages, supply chain issues, *cough WW3 cough*, etc. No matter the situation we all need some things to get by: we need food, water, shelter, some hygiene and medical stuff, and so on. You don't have to stack ""emergency supplies"" but you do need to stack shelf stable food items. I don't like to live by ""just in time inventory"". I prefer to have my working daily pantry, then have extra tucked away that I can pull from as needed. Can't get to the store for a few days, a week, a few weeks? I'm good.<br /><br />Buy a few extra things every single time you go to the store. Don't need to stockpile all at once. Little bit here and there adds up nicely. If you get to a spot that you feel comfortable and have the budget, then grab the ""emergency"" items like ReadyWise, Nutristore, Augason, etc offers. I like adding it in and just forgetting about it. It provides a good feeling (psychologically comforting) knowing that something is there if/when needed. Also works great as camping or hiking food (again if price is right). Looking for some practical gift giving ideas? I am a big fan of survival gear, food, tools. I'm known to give smoke detectors and batteries, fire extinguishers, rechargeable light bulbs, and for the extra special in my life-- emergency food. Ones that will recognize the importance.<br /><br />Anyway, all told.. I give 5 stars because the can arrived in perfect condition, arrived quickly, chicken smells and tastes as expected. It is exactly as it should be. Price is insane to me, but I knew the price when I ordered.",0.996,1360,18.63013698630137,0.0,2.2988
"Pointing out a few things brought up in reviews:<br /><br />1. This is DEHYDRATED zucchini, NOT freeze-dried. Very different methods, different results, different pricing. While Mother Earth does carry some freeze dried, they do not have freeze dried zucchini. Another way to tell? With freeze dried foods, they can be eaten as is (crunchy snack) or rehydrated. Where as with dehydrated foods, most all (except fruits, usually) will need to be rehydrated in order to consume them (too tough to eat). This will require soaking and/or cooking for a period of time. Can't just toss it in the dish you are making and expect it to cook up quickly. So for this, it says to simmer 1 part zucchini to 2 parts water for 10-30 minutes. This very well may take longer. I let it cook for no less than 30 minutes before adding it to what I ultimately want to have it be part of. Another way to get it started is to let soak, then follow up with a shorter simmer.<br /><br />2. 1/2 cup dried zucchini = 1 cup cooked zucchini. I made up 1/4 cup and it made a very good sized portion. See my pics.<br /><br />3. End result is NOT EVER going to be same as fresh. Stop that. Then stop blaming the company/brand. YOu will always be disappointed. Best thing to get if you cant get fresh or frozen is to find a company who makes freeze dried. Even then, you are expecting a lot from zucchini. This is similar to others, and there aren't many out there to choose from.<br /><br />4. Shelf life can be very very long, if not indefinite if stored under proper conditions. Freeze dried for sure, but dehydrated can last a very long time. Be sure to keep it in well sealed container, out of light and dampness. Maybe keep in freezer or further repackaged into mylar or vac sealed jar.<br /><br />5. Taste is neutral. Kind of like how zucchini can be. I could tell it was zucchini though! I found that with proper rehydration it worked well in adding bulk to tacos, and can always be added to soup. I see it as a nutritional item rather than a way to have a plate of zucchini. Nice way to bulk up meals, add vitamins and minerals, yet not have to rely on fresh (for various reasons). I noticed that the skins were more like late summer yellow squash/zucchini. Kinda reminded me of regular squash- like butternut skins.  Not tough but had more ""presence"" I shall say. DID not taste or feel like ""tree bark"" in any way.<br /><br />6. If planning on using it in zucchini bread, muffins, cookies, or sauces, I would recommend running it through the blender after it has been rehydrated. Make it more of a puree. This will impart flavor and decrease any tougher bits.<br /><br />7. Says processed and packaged in USA, but WHERE do they get their vegetables from?? That I havent seen, here or on their web page<br /><br />8. If you dont like this packaging, they also offer mylar bag style.<br /><br />OVERALL: I think it is fine, and it as expected. I love seeing it in my pantry knowing that I have a variety of dehydrated foods to use when I cant get fresh, or food is scarce, or food doesnt look good, or I cant afford it that day. Buy a little here and there and stock up those cupboards. Would like to know where the zucchini comes from?<br /><br />PS. I miss when we could comment and ask questions of other reviewers.

"I started with Niagara Falls NY as that is my hometown region. It was number 17 in the list. A little tricky at first to figure out where you're headed as the labeling for each workout is a bunch of generic numbers and letters. But peppered into the mix is the state abbreviation.<br /><br />The walk was ok, there were some moves that I wouldnt exactly consider beginner, unconditioned, or senior friendly. So I just modified. I found that her repeated expression, ""did you get it?"" to be grating. I eventually turned off volume and trudged through the rest.<br /><br />I like that all the walks are half an hour. I like that there are so many different environments. At least that keeps it mildly interesting. I like the non traditional progress indicator (not count up or count down, but %)<br /><br />Because of the first one I tried had such repetitive commentary ""did you get it?"", I haven't felt compelled to work through the others. I will. But I really prefer Leslie Sansone. Even so, I give this 4 stars (3.5 if I could).<br /><br />I popped this into the back of my smart tv.

"Big fan of prepping for emergencies and whatever else that may impact food supplies. I buy from Augason Farms regularly. I have never had any major issues or concerns with any of their products. Sellers yes, products no. I buy emergency food and tuck it away. I try to buy when on sale because I am basically buying food and not eating it. I rarely get into it, or rotate it. If I am buying from Augason farms, then the packaging is just fine for super long term storage (10-25 years depending on the food item). I get the occasional dented can (this one was fine), and it makes no impact. It isnt like other food grade cans where the can is breeched. These cans are made to withstand floods and other crazy stuff. They float, did you know that? Sometimes I will get into a can early if I bought it on sale and it is same price or cheaper than non long term storage equivalent (recently I experienced that with powdered butter. My usual bagged brand was more expensive than the sale price of Augason powdered butter.. stuff like that).<br /><br />Anyway, I like the corn to be consumed as is, tossed in a big bowl of salad, or rehydrated when used in soups or as a side. Not my number one prep item, but it does add variety.<br /><br />Occasionally I see people post reviews that say they got an expired product. But they never show a picture of the date they are looking at. The cans show the manufacture date first and foremost, then follows the best by date many many many years in the future. If they got an expired product, then do the math. That means the product would have been made 10-25 years ago. I mean, maybe. Lets see the label. They change the look of their label on occasion. So anyway, I am always suspect of those reviews. I just think they arent reading it right, and if it was legit they would post a pic of the can.",0.8168,407,16.958333333333332,1.5,2.6950399999999997
"Lightweight, silky, gentle on hair. Stretchy fabric to accommodate various head sizes, even my 23.75"" head, albeit a tad snug. The product description says 22.8-25.5.

Stretchy material can be scrunched into a band, or spread out to protect more of the hair, or for looks.<br /><br />I wear visors of some sort every day. I prefer to keep sun off my face. I have a lot of hair, so I always use the open style so I can keep my hair piled on top if my head. I work outside a lot, as well as spend a lot of time outdoors with my dogs, or going for walks, etc. This stays on my head well. and overall I like it. But it is outside my usual style. I branched open a bit on this one.<br /><br />That being said, love to hate it, hate to love it. It is a tad foo foo for me. I say that because of the material. It is soft, silky, and the visor brim has a light foam feel. Something I see for ultra casual use by the poolside, or beach, or maybe even glamping. Exercise? maybe. The material may be a bit too much. Not for outdoor work, physical labor. That's fine. Something for everyone. I think it is rather cute, and I kinda like the different look and feel of it.

"These are made well, and the colors are vibrant with various designs. When I see multi packs, I usually decide ahead of time how many I will actually like to use. Then I decide from there. Sometimes they are same as shown, sometimes different. These are same as shown in upper most picture. Since I could see the designs included, I knew there were a few I would really like, and the rest will be my less preferred headbands when it comes time to use one. Cute ones for heading out and about, less cute for doing gross chores.<br /><br />I have a big head- 23.75"", so I wasn't surprised when these fit a little more snug than I care for. But they fit. There is plenty of stretch. I really like that they are extra wide. I can simple fold them in half if I want a more narrow band, or scrunch them for cute casual look, or wear them full extended for the most coverage of forehead and hair.<br /><br />The material is dense. It is stretchy, but its a tight stretch some from the size, but much directly related to the material. It is cotton and spandex. No idea how much spandex, but I assume a higher amount because of the combo of stretch and snug fit (will stretch but fit snug i think regardless of head size)<br /><br />Well packaged. I think the boxing is cute. Small box, hinged lid, tissue covering rolled and labeled headbands. Just has pleasing appearance. Gift worthy if you know anyone that would like something like this.<br /><br />I always use sweat bands that serve as head bands. I have tiny hairs that drop down and annoy me, so I like to keep my hair pulled up off my face entirely with bands like this. Also works for use in doing make up, washing face, using face mask. If you use virtual reality and find yourself sweating under the googles, I like using bands such as this to help.<br /><br />One last use that I have is for keeping my visor on.

"[[VIDEOID:73ea107022e84b9c32bb6c27dca6f19c]] Nice blanket. I dont do much camping, but I wanted a camp style blanket for my car.

And the reasonable price.<br /><br />Can be zipped into a sleeping bag style, through it will be more narrow than a regular sleeping bag. It can be doubled up with another of same to make for a larger bag. That might be good if preparing car for a couple of people.

"4-5 stars for product, 1 star for seller experience. Read on, buyer beware. My rating is based solely on the actual product as everything has otherwise been since resolved, but 0 stars for seller experience. Please read on for more info.<br /><br />I love Augason Farms, and buy their products often (usually on sale as I am just tucking this stuff away). But this seller (which has changed names 3x) is something to be concerned over and stay away from. I will from now on only look for legit Augason Farms sellers. I would put this rating in the seller rating portion, but they dont show up as one I can rate (because they keep changing names).<br /><br />For shame. They had a sale on the 72 hour 1 person kits. They offer a pack of 1 and they offer a pack of 2. The pack of 2 is what was on sale, and it made it a better bargain over the single container. I put in an order of TWO, 2 packs. Then after I put in my order, I decided to buy more, so I bought another TWO, 2 packs. So in all I should have 8 pails arriving. I figured the small compact size, and assortment would add nicely to my other supplies. I considered giving away one of the order sets as the price was so reasonable and it could help someone out. I see that I am not the only one who experienced this. We clearly all made purchases at same time.<br /><br />Well then I get a message that one full order has been cancelled (some BS excuse), then the other set (4 pails total) was lost in UPS. Then suddenly a box arrived, and it had two pails. So in all I received one quarter of my order. Half reimbursed by seller initiative, the other with help of Amazon. Oy, I tried to get it fixed on my own. I sent a message, and never heard back. So I contacted customer service and got it sorted out. Thanks, Amazon :)<br /><br />So here I am reviewing the product itself, but letting you know that you are taking a chance. Buyer beware. This is not regarding the product or the company, it is regarding the sellers. The product itself is FINE.  SO.. on to that:<br /><br />Take a look at the product pictures to see all what is in it, and all what you can expect in terms of calories and assortment. Don't cry that it isnt enough food even though it clearly says it has 2560 calories per day.7680 calories per pail. If it isnt enough for you, then adjust accordingly. Get more variety, or simply tuck this away for super desperate times.  It is compact, it is dense calories, and it is meant to be used as emergency food. You will survive in 2500+ cals per day. Might not be what you would normally eat, not be the bulk and texture you normally go for.. but none of this should be a surprise. It is all listed.<br /><br />I knew looking at it that it is food of nearly all the same texture, and some of the calories are taken up by banana chips (high calorie, tasty, but not much bulk). I knew I would be adding this into a wide assortment of supplies to choose from. I can add food to this to make it more interesting, or use it as intended: provide me a few days of food.<br /><br />If I experience anything else, or think of anything else worth sharing I will be back to do so.",0.9956,743,20.08108108108108,0.7,2.10868
"Sturdy cup with attached twist off lid. Stuffed inside is:<br />--ONE red medical bag with a variety of bandages, an empty zip lock bag, 4 alcohol wipes (fresh, plenty wet enough to wipe down fingers, phone, and keyboard), 2 sting relief pads, and a large triangular bandage. The little red medical bag has zipper closure, and has a mesh pocket on outside. This was hard to get out of the cup.<br />-- ONE mylar emergency blanket in zip lock bag. Also a challenge to wrangle out from cup<br />--ONE Pen light with clip, which needs 2 AAA batteries (non included)<br />--ONE Large, bright orange whistle that works with ease. Attached (cheap) carrying strap. One end has a working compass (it works, and is accurate. Mine anyway). One end can be twisted off to store smaller items. Nothing comes with it inside. I stuck my pinky finger in and didnt reach the end, so matches and such would be good.<br />-- ONE tea light. Appears to be a 4 hour (max) tea light.<br />--ONE basic but sturdy multi-tool in a black canvas sheath. Includes a key ring<br />-- ONE chemical body warmer. If it works, then it is a really nice addition. Can be used for pain, and can be used for added body warmth. I rely greatly on these warmers, and find them a must have for any emergency kit.<br />--ONE D-ring carabiner. Nice addition but it is super basic and cheap, really should have gone with something of more functional size. Dont rely on this. Anything would be better. Doesnt even work to hold the cup to a bag. Just too small, and will likely break.<br />--ONE fire starter stick<br />--and, ONE sturdy cup. Just a cup, will need to supply your own filtering if that is what you run up against. The twist cap has a reflective appearance. I can see myself, hence using this as a crappy mirror if needed. Not for vanity, but maybe I have something on my face or in my eye. Not sure if it would be enough for reflection in a signal, but its possible in a low key way.<br /><br />If just using it for holding all this stuff, know that there is a little extra room for additional personalization. I'd add in a packet of pain reliever, an electrolyte powder (I buy tear off sticks for convenience), a nutrient dense snack- packet of peanut butter, maybe and a fruit/nut bar? water filtration tablets. Petroleum based chap stick. Possibilities are endless, so just think through a potential situation and work up from there. I want to be warm, dry, hydrated, and preferably fed, and be able to make some noise.<br /><br />Overall a fair compilation. As with any survival gear, it comes down to the individual needs and ability to use said items. Also, there is so much variety out there, that pin pointing what to have or not to have is subjective. This gives a decent foundation of items. I'll put this in my car, or add to my every day carry bag. I personally like the addition of the chemical body warmer. That paired with the blanket will make all the difference in comfort. The whistle and compass (with additional storage) is the item I am most pleasantly surprised with. Some whistles take a lot of oomph to get sound, which isnt helpful if it is something you need in a dire situation. That and the compass is actually accurate and works quickly. I have purchased similar items and have had the compass not read correctly. No good if it isnt accurate! This is good. Penlight is nice addition. Just be sure to add batteries if you dont see any in your cup.<br /><br />Minor differences from product picture and product description.  The picture shows a pack of batteries, mine did not have any. The product description doesnt mention them at all (not even a reminder that we will need them). The fire starter stick is different, I think mine is better than what is shown in picture. Picture shows 2 body warmers, and product description says 1. My cup has 1.<br /><br />As for getting everything back in once I got it out? Eh, with some finesse, yes.<br /><br />4 stars. (could have been 5 if the product pictures, product description, and what I have in hand lined up- the differences may make or break someone buying choice. Again, overall I think it is a decent set that I got). $29 is reasonable price at time of review in 05/2022",0.9919,963,17.833333333333332,0.0,1.89757
"I normally dont buy emergency meals like this, even on sale they are pricy. But I decided to buy it on a whim. I usually have very good experience with buying basic packets of pasta dishes. Some I have just let sit on my shelves for several years, and then when I made it it tastes fine. Some have had reduced flavor, but still edible. Then I have done some where I repackaged in mylar (no special preparation), and that boosted the freshness. So more or less this is reason why i have avoided the emergency containers. But, I have been adding various ingredients to my long term storage, and have been buying when on sale. This was on sale, and so I just decided to add one container on a whim. I like that it contains a few mylar pouches as opposed to opening the canister and it just being an open container of a pasta meal. For that, I really found it worth buying.",0.934,187,17.0,1.8,2.8202

"I buy Augason products when they are on sale. Been doing this on and off for a few years now. Always been a bit of a ""prepper"", since I was a toddler it seems, haha (In my 40s now). I has served me well through power outages, sicknesses, unemployment, and even bigger stuff like the pandemic, and now... *vaguely gestures around* everything else that is going on. I've never been one to be without when anything has come up. I never did ""emergency food"" if only because I didnt have the budget. I would stick with typical foods and try to store them well. Well now I have a little more wiggle room in my budget, and with the on and off sales of long term storage (20+ years), I take advantage when I can. I remember buying some Augason eggs back in 2019 for $19. Today? $33-56 for same container, depending on the day. So yeh, keep an eye on prices, buy on sale. If just starting skip the ""emergency"" food, and just work on picking up extra cans and bags of stuff every time you hit the market. Food lasts a whole lot longer than what the ""expiration date"" claims. No need to fuss. Just store in cool dark area, and from personal experience nothing really goes bad bad. Except acidic products where you want to rotate those out. Or ground brown grains, as the oils can get gross. But even pasta and flour has been perfectly fine for several years without fuss. That being said, if you are at point that you want to buy it and forget it, then buying some emergency cans and buckets of food can take the guess workout. Hence, products like what Augason Farms offers.<br /><br />And so, I haven't opened this 2lbs 6 ounce can of ""chicken"" crumbles.. sorry. I dont intend to open this any time soon. My can looks good, and it feels heavy. All goof. I have quite a bit of bagged stuff to get through first, and I will likely continue to top off from stuff I get to store, then simply know I have this as back up to the back up. I'm not vegan nor vegetarian, but I have no problem incorporating some meat alternatives. I simply eat everything and so I stack my pantry depicting this. Options are good!  And with this,  I wanted to shore up my non meat options. Having this, and some veggies, some soups and biscuiot mixes, etc.. all can lend to a good meal.<br /><br /> I have a slew of reviews to write on various Augason products, and so they will all be pretty much the same: Super long term storage (25+ years, unless a bread/biscuit mix then it might be closer to 10 years), no matter what the weight, it will be stuffed into a #10 can (that reads, ""number ten"", not ten pound. I see that mistake in reviews). They keep sizes uniform. Next size up is a round bucket, next size up gets into the rectangular buckets. This is for storage that can be uniform, etc. So yes, you may buy a 7 ounce item that is volume wise that takes up a smidge of space, but it will be packed into a large #10 container. Just remember, all food products are sold based on weight, not volume anyway. All of my containers have been in perfect condition. Maybe one day soon I will try one container out and see how the product actually is.<br /><br />Everyone's SHTF scenario varies. It could be bad weather (tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms), could be illness, could be road trip gone wrong (you do keep supplies in your car too, right?!), could be unemployment, or power outage, or lack of transportation, or oven/fridge/other appliance break down, or bigger stuff like plagues, food shortages, supply chain issues, *cough WW3 cough*, etc. No matter the situation we all need some things to get by: we need is food, water, shelter, some hygeine and medical stuff, and so on. You dont have to stack ""emergency supplies"" but you do need to stack shelf stable food items. Buy a few extra things every single time you go to the store. If you get to a spot that you feel comfortable and have the budget, then grab the ""emergency"" items like Augason offers.

"I have the ""3-4"" person option. I chose this after carefully considering the dimensions. In my experience, I get  3 person tents for just myself. I am tall and wide, and want room to move, and have space for gear. The difference between their 2 person tent and ""3-4"" person tent is not much in one direction, but it adds quite a bit of space in another. So no matter what, if you have 2 people and get the two people tent you will be shoulder to shoulder, and if you 3 people for a 3 person tent, you will be shoulder to shoulder. So where does a 4th person go? Along the 3 peoples feet (or head). I wont be person #4. haha<br />SIZE :<br />2 people (82.67"" X 59.05"" X 47.24"")<br />4 people (86.67"" X 82.67"" X 59.05"" )<br /><br />That being said, I got the 3-4 person tent for use for myself and my 2 large labs. Not necessarily for camping (though will do for that), but as a prep item in case the electric goes out or heat goes out. Sleeping can be much more comfortable (and survivable) if the space around you is reduced. So furnace out in a blizzard? House getting real cold? Get layered up, set up a tent INSIDE the house (or even on the bed, or make a layered bed roll), and your body heat will be contained. Add a handful of cats and a couple of big labs, and we have a toasty sweat lodge, haha. Not sure where my husband will sleep. He can have a bivvy on other side of room, haha.<br /><br />Internal hook for hanging a light. Bag is big enough to be able to get the tent back inside.<br /><br />I happen to already have a couple of tents of this size, but I have had them for like 20 years and I havent used them in about 10 years.. so I wanted to ""freshen up"" my preps. Had a little sticker shock, but this seamed to be reasonable price for the size I chose. The two person appears doable if for 1 person and some gear, or a couple of slim people who like each other a lot. The 3/4 person is more for me and my preferences. I keep a tent in my car. I have kept one as an emergency item since I first began driving as a teen. Now in my 40s, it is just a habit. I can sleep in my car, but I am a big fan of options. Many times I went camping on the fly because I had everything I needed in my trunk. Still do. Why not?<br /><br />4 stars because everything looks good. I havent truly put it through its paces yet. I dont expect it to fall apart. I have had dirt cheap tents last forever, so I just expect this to hold up. I'll update if I learn anything else.",0.8894,617,19.28125,0.3,1.9568200000000002
"If I would have received the amount that I paid for, I would give this 5 stars. BUT, I received 3 ounces, half the size that is shown. They show 6 OUNCES in the picture, AND the price per ounce reflects this too. But no, I got HALF THE SIZE. I would not have purchased this. I saw some OLD reviews saying this (recently and going back 5 years).. and same story. People spending their good money for a 6 ounce container and getting 3. COME ON. So SHAMEful. Fix it.<br /><br />That being said, if you want to chance it, know that this is a decent product. Nice size flakes, works well in soups, casseroles, meat loaf. I've been trying it in some soups, rice, and mixing it into meatballs, meat loafs. I bought this primarily to make sure I have some shelf stable vegetables. I go through a lot of various veggies, and now adays items are low in availability (I'm not driving all over for groceries), look sad, or are too pricy. This just helps assure me that I still have my staples. I've been meaning to do my own hydrating for a few years now, but haven't taken the plunge. In the mean time, I stock up on what is commercially available. I like this brand, and may consider more but it can't be from Amazon.<br /><br />Spinach is a favorite for amping up the healthy aspect of a meal. I really like these dehydrated flakes as it is still close to looking, tasting, feeling like spinach but just in very small pieces. Another option I use is powder form.

"Very good. I keep an assortment of dehydrated or freeze dried foods on hand for use anytime, but also as part of emergency use. It is easy to forget about the small stuff such as spices and other flavorings. If ya got to eat beans and rice, you will want to have many ways to spice it up. But for day to day use it is super convenient. I dont run out to the store all the time. I try to keep the basics on hand, but sometimes some foods just arent available, are way too pricy, or what is there looks super sad. I need my ""mire poix""!! (celery, onion, carrot). Sooooo I have an assortment of the dried versions in my working pantry.<br /><br />I like the cut of this, and how it rehydrates. Works really well in my soups and other applications that benefit from a little added celery. I may buy some more soon just to have extra on hand.",0.9822,196,16.333333333333332,0.2,2.35466
"I use a lot of peppers. I buy them when available, but most often I am buying pre diced frozen, which is what I prefer for most applications. Wanting to make sure I have these tasty bits available to me at all times, I keep dehydrated on hand as well. Works so well to grab a handful as needed. I am partial to Augason Farms for shelf stable foods. I used these and am happy.<br /><br />I didnt weigh my container. I bought to cans (always comes in the the same large container no matter the amount inside). I will open and weigh my second container.

Very important to me to have ""mire poix"", so I keep dehydrated onions, celery, and carrots on hand--goes a long way toward flavoring a lot of foods, and amping up nutrition. As well some peppers, eggs, and a few other basic staples that make my life easier. Veggies are nice for tossing into soups, muffins, etc. When I cant get fresh, or I dont feel like chopping, the dehydrated stuff is great to have.<br /><br />Also, whatever next is on our Apocalypse Bingo Card, I just want to be ready.",0.8501,161,23.0,1.8,2.79503
"Has anyone tried this? The main filtering aspect seems good, which to me is the most important. But if you are buying this because of the extras, be careful. Here are the details:<br />--WHISTLE: it works, on or off the filter tube. It twists on/off. Be sure to keep track of it. LOUD.<br />--COMPASS:  Mine doesn't work. It won't adjust to correct direction, or any direction. It doesn't move, period. I had it side by side with one of my other compasses, and it did nothing. Bummer.<br />--MIRROR: The flip side of the compass has a mirror, for signaling etc. Twist off compass end to access. Very clear, looks good. Slightly smaller than size of a quarter.<br />--D-ring clip: mediocre, might want something else. It is attached via a basic ""key ring"", which is then attached through the molded plastic piece on the tube.<br />--STRAW: this includes a piece of rubber tubing for attaching to filter and using as a straw- either in a bottle, or to add length for being able to access a water source. Will need to figure out way to carry this separately (dont lose it!). Basic tubing size, so should be easy to replace or buy longer tubing.<br />--FILTER: all points to it working!<br />OK, back to the filter. I used it on tap water. I suppose I could have wandered out to my creek and grabbed some water. Maybe I will still do that. While our tap water tastes fine, it is noticeably different compared to our on board fridge water filter. I tried this is a mason jar with tap water. I followed directions (blow first to exhaust, then gently draw up water). I could tell how silky smooth the water tasted with no other tastes coming through. I then took a sip of the tap water without the filter straw and could note the ""flavor"". So this straw is filtering something for sure.<br /><br />I have lifestraws, and now this. I am a big fan of redundancy and variety, and the saying ""two is one and one is none"". I keep straws in my ""bug out bag"", and truck ""get home bag"". I have even kept on in my purse. Must have for hiking bag. Having viable water source is #1 for me. These things aren't too expensive, so I find it an easy, budget friendly addition to emergency preparedness. The price is spot on for a single straw. Wish the compass worked.",0.9886,534,15.705882352941176,0.0,1.8965800000000002
"Cute bottle, but didnt come with a bottle brush. Also, the bottle came without any protective material- it was just tossed in box with other items I ordered. After the disappointment of those two aspects, I got to know my water bottle. It is actually rather nice. I have many water bottles, mostly in the 32 ounce range. I have a gallon sized container, but that is a tad cumbersome to lug around with me as my main bottle.<br /><br />I wanted a 64 ounce bottle to help keep me hydrated through workouts, especially those that I do using an Oculus Quest 2 VR unit. I play Supernatural, Workout Near Go far fitness app and I go through a lot of water. My 32 ounce bottle isnt enough, so normally I have a second or third stacked nearby. I figure a 64 ounce container should help me through most workouts, and I can have the 32 ounce bottle as back up. I was concerned that it would be hard to drink from while wearing the headset, but so long as I have the cap flipped open and angled to either cheek, I can drink from it just fine.<br /><br />I like the outer material, the stretchy pocket (perfect for gloss, tissues. Not big enough for my phone w/ case), and the handle is real sturdy. Makes it easy to carry. The carrying strap is a nice touch as I just swing that onto my shoulder as I head out the door, which I have done a few times now without issue.<br /><br />Straw feels a little clumsy at first, but it stays in place and I get a good draw. Best when I am drawing down on it rather than letting it tip back.<br /><br />Overall I am mostly pleased. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could (for lack of brush, and unprotected packaging--ew), but otherwise the actual bottle performance has been solid. I will be right back here to update if I experience anything else.",0.9903,406,25.375,0.2,1.95709
"Not as warm as anticipated. I rely on hand, toe, body warmers. I often use Hot Hands brand, but have successfully used off brands. I dont know why these dont get that warm. I have even used warmers well beyond their best by date and still had them work fine. These DO get warm, but the heat doesnt pump out. Very weak. Not a repurchase.<br /><br />I typically wear layers. A tank top, then a long sleeved top on top. Since these warmers are not meant to be used directly on skin, I stuck one on my tank top. When that didnt feel like anything, I then turned it around and stuck in on the inside of the long sleeved shirt (so the outer heat pad directed toward my body). Still nothing noticeable. If I touch it, it was warm, but I didnt feel a cozy radiating heat like I normally would with other body warmers. I even took it off, exposed it to air again, and put it back. By then the sticky part is becoming less effective. I even put a sweatshirt on, and didnt feel anything significant.<br /><br />I will use them up as there is some warmth. They are a good size, but are flat enough that I could put it in my shoes or gloves easily. Some warmth is better than nothing, but I really expected more given my experience.",0.993,283,15.72222222222222,0.0,1.4979000000000002
"Functions as expected from any Hot Hands products. Nice and toasty warm. Adhesive could be stronger, but I dont have any problem using these in my shoes. These are absolutely 60% larger than their usual toe warmer size. They take up the entire width of my wide size 10/11 women's feet (size 9 men's), and about half the length. Clearly make your choice based on this knowledge. If you have skinny short feet, then continue with their regular toe product.<br /><br />Heat lasts ALL DAY. If heat feels like it has reduced, then simply expose to air again for a few seconds. I am perpetually impressed with how long the chemical warmers do their job.<br /><br />As with any Hot Hands products, these can be used elsewhere on body if need be. I keep packets of Hot Hands products in my car, in my purse, in my coat pocket. It can make all the difference in comfort just by having some added warmth. Must have for car emergency kit, BOB/GO bags, and hiking packs.<br /><br />I am an avid user of ""Hot Hands"" products (feet, hands, body, any of them!). While I use them all, I especially rely on the foot warms for helping my feet keep a consistent temperature during the winter. I experience RAYNAUDS SYNDROME, which presents as icy feeling pained toes (and fingers) from extended vasoconstriction. So imagine your extremities getting cold from grabbing a frozen product from freezer. Keep holding it, and the discomfort increases. Let go, and the discomfort lessens and feels fine shortly after. With Raynauds, that discomfort increases even after the trigger is taken away, and the sensation can remain for quite awhile. With severe cases this can lead to skin ulcers. I dont have that, but my fingers and toes will feel raw, like they have been scraped open. Maintaining a constant temperature is Key. It isn't just about being warm (I couldn't just go put my hands/feet in front of a heater to make the sensation go away, in fact that can be worse). The main thing is to try to keep those areas from having the vessels constrict. SO, I help maintain that constant temp by using toe warmers, pretty much all through fall, winter (especially), and spring.<br /><br />I really dont need these extra large toe warmers for my typical needs, but the larger size is divine feeling, and the added size makes it easy to use on other body parts. Love the flat toe warmer style even for use in my gloves.",0.9931,522,20.88,0.2,2.35793
"TAKE NOTE that THE SIZE: is 17"" wide, 15"" long, and 5"" deep.<br /><br />The product description shows the measurements in two spots, depending on where you look it will be smaller or larger than the measurements I took. In the written headline, the sizing is listed as 15""x13""x3.5"".  In the PICTURE portion, it says that it is 20.5"" Long X 14.7"" Wide X 15.4"" deep (lol, it is not 15+ inches deep!)<br /><br />The third spot, for ""package dimensions"" is closed to my measurements.<br /><br />So for the big discrepancies, I down rate to 4. Product is otherwise a solid 5.<br /><br />---The straps for securing a yoga mat (or roll of towel, clothes, etc) is well designed. I was concerned about placement of those straps. I couldnt tell where they were anchored. I didnt know if they were anchored outside, and that there would be flopping straps when not in use Or are they anchored inside, and I would need to have the bag open to access the straps.  But in fact, they are anchored in the bag, tucked away, and can be accessed by pulling them through open ports. So this means that the bag can be fully closed, and the straps can be pulled out from side holes, and then used to strap whatever you want onto it.<br /><br />---The REALLY COOL feature of this is that they aren't limited to strapping something large on. They have press hooks- so you can hook your keys, or hand sanitzer bottle, etc. Pull the strap through to have it as a hook on outside of bag, or keep it tucked inside for a hook inside the bag. The other side is a D ring, so if you have a carbiner or other press hook, then you can use this to attach it to. Really good design in this regards. Makes it a more versatile tote.<br /><br />---Interior is like a purse. Instead of interior side pockets, there is an interior center panel that has a zipper portion (with additional swivel pressure hook) and a wide open pocket which begs for a water bottle.  Remainder of tote is open. Not sure if I like how the interior panel is attached. It is just in the center and doesnt run length of bag. It could have still be attached to the side with ability to put a water bottle in. Maybe with more use I will figure out if this is a good design or not. It doesnt really hinder use, and it might in fact add more options for someone.<br /><br />--Exterior on one side has a zipper pocket and an open pocket. Opposite side has an open pocket.<br /><br />---Material is sturdy, durable, and I am assuming water resistant, if not waterproof. It has a flat bottom, like a narrow rectangle. Lies flat when empty/not in use.<br /><br />---Nice long adjustable shoulder strap with padded shoulder portion. Long enough for cross body use.<br /><br />---The shoulder strap is also optional. It is attached via D ring and pressure clip on a swivel. (similar to style of the yoga mat straps). Very durable feeling.  Cant tell if it is a thick heavy plastic or is metal. Either way, I feel confident in its durability, strength<br /><br />--Also has comfortable hand straps, that are just long enough to get up on the shoulder.<br /><br />OVERALL: I like it. It is the size and style that I like for an everyday carry. I dont go into stores or other places with big purses, but I do like to carry a variety of stuff. So I have my main items and then the items of the day. I then keep it in the car as I go about my day.<br /><br />Whether you are using it for gym stuff, personal stuff, or switch back and forth between the two, I think you will like it. I dont rate on price, but I do comment. I am currently using [[ASIN:B07WT75VTZ  baggallini Avenue Tote Top Handle Bag]] as my every day ""carry all"". I own several bags, all similarly priced. Excellent quality, so I rarely stray. I am familiar with Gaiam products, and this price for their quality is within reason.",0.9966,917,22.925,0.5,2.0489800000000002
"I had little expectation, especially after some of the reviews. I pulled it from box, and it is just one long stretchy band. It has a loop! It has velco. So far so good. BUT, NO INSTRUCTIONS! It didn't take me long to figure it out (feed material through loop then back wrap it so the ending velcro hoot/latch closer lines up, otherwise it will be on opposite sides), but I think some instructions of some sort would go a long way. There is so much useless garb on the box, but nothing actually helpful. Lame.<br /><br />Anyway, I am 5'10, have a long torso, weigh #265, am a size 18/20, have an apron belly/fupa, and happen to have more of an hourglass shape already. I decided to try this for two reasons: pressure on my waist and hips feels good when I have an episode of sciatica. So my initial interest was for medical reason. Second reason was curiosity in use as a waist trimmer.<br /><br />I was floored to see my lumpy belly smooth down and disappear. I could use more length in order to really cover the entire area, but I focused on my upper belly and worked my way down. CRAZY.<br /><br />I expected it to roll. It didn't. I thought I would put it on then have to take it off, but I was able to wear it all day (at home), and do my usual stuff-- sit around, do some chores, do a workout. IT STAYED IN PLACE. And I dont even know what I am doing.<br /><br />I reeeeeeeaaaaaaallllllly liked seeing myself firmed up with smooth, smaller dimension. I didnt expect the vanity boost.<br /><br />Then LATER, when I took it off, my body still kinda held shape. I looked less puffy. I know it was temporary, but it was rather impressive experience for my first time use. Seeing how my body could be and is underneath the flarb gives me incentive to workout harder and pay closer attention to my eating habits.<br /><br />Doubt I would ever use this outside my house as it absolutely does push some flarb up and out.

"Must have for frigid winter days. Although labeled for use with hands, I find that they work well stuffed into my slippers or boots, or shirt. The foot variety is best for that, but the hand warmers work well too as they are still on the small side. If you get ""hand and body"" then those are little too big.<br /><br />I find that they help so much in keeping my hands comfortable. I deal with Raynauds syndrome, which can make fingers and toes feel like they are touching ice. Keeping those areas at a steady temperature (its the fluctuations that trigger the episode) helps keep me comfortable. And of course, its just nice to be comfy cozy any other time I am feeling cold.<br /><br />Pro tip: when using these to keep hands warm, I like to have a thin pair of gloves on, then a pair of mittens on with a warmer tucked in between. This seems to help the heat to reach my fingers better than if I were to try to just use it tucked into the gloves.<br /><br />I buy packs of this size (and larger) for ease of being able to grab a handfful to keep in my car, in my purse, near my entryway. I keep some in my hiking bag too no matter what time of year. A little added heats makes all the difference when the need arises.",0.9956,284,28.4,0.9,2.56868
"Easy gentle heat. These are the typical size for ""hand warmers"". No problems. No better no worse than any other I have used (including name brands). I usually use them in my socks though to help keep my toes at a constant temperature. I suffer from Raynauds Syndrome, and I greatly help combat it by keeping my feet from being exposed to fluctuating temps. So for me it is a must have. I dont always buy the ones meant for feet, usually the hand ones are priced better. All the same to me. Of course, use them anywhere- in pockets, in gloves, in hat, tucked into chest area. A must have for comfort from cold, and definitely a needful thing to keep in the car (emergency kit, etc). Can make all the difference!<br /><br />After exposure to air, the warmers start heating up. Full heat within 20 minutes. Keeps heat all day.<br /><br />Thinking of buying another box as winter hasn't even officially begun yet.",0.9732,210,15.0,0.0,2.29196
"Basic thin transparent poncho, like a garbage can liner. Totally works in a pinch. I keep a supply of these on hand and they are incredibly handy when needed. Inexpensive enough to use once and toss, yet durable enough to use several times over. Lightweight, generous size, packs well in a hiking bag, glove box, purse, etc. Nice to have extra on hand for use in covering up gear during a downpour and no shelter. It's just one of those things that are greatly appreciated when the need arises.

"Super long (90+ inches long) and durable, basically as expected and required. While it could be used more than once, it is really one of those things that are a one and done sort of thing (it will never fold back down small). It is the typical long tube. It includes a length of very basic cordage. I prefer a more robust paracord, so if you have that, maybe use it instead. The added length of the tent is to allow it to keep out the elements and to be able to scrunch it it in. Perfect for keeping gear at one end, and exit/entry point at the other. Of course, how much room you have left over depends on your body size. I have never had one rip. Good for short term shelter and warmth.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the tents. I always keep one in my every day carry, and my hiking bag. While I do keep emergency blankets on hand, I actually prefer these tents over the flat blankets as it can be used as a sleeping bag. or can be cut and shared.<br /><br />Cheap enough worth while addition to any pack, emergency kit, car kit, etc. I love stuff like this and often replenish, and often buy stuff like this as gifts.<br /><br />I dont rate on price, but I do comment. Current price of $8.33 is a little more than I normally spend on the tents, but not entirely unreasonable. It is perfectly fine quality, and will do the job as needed.

I think the machine utters something about blue tooth, but there is nothing else to be said of it. The manual does not mention it at all. It has a USB port, which does not make it blue tooth. So maybe I will plug something in at some point. In the mean time, I just set this up near my TV.<br /><br />If you know what to do, and what you are using this for, and have no need of any helpful information, then this machine is surprisingly sturdy and provides lots of vibrations. I see other machines that include ebooks, video links, and more robust info. I just really expected something of this caliber to have an up to date manual and have more information. I see now that they say in the product description that their manual is not up to date and to refer to product page (not any more helpful), but that fries me..

No silicone grips in case you were wondering/looking for that info.<br /><br />Is comfortable and sits well on my large head. I didn't expect these to stay in place, but they do a good job of not budging. As with most material headbands of this style, they do best when closer to forehead. BUT I have even worn them further back on my head and it stayed in place. Not sure how? lol.  When more forward on my head (and just touching forehead) I can move around all day and it stays totally in place.<br /><br />I often wear my hair up, and I like a little colorful flair. I also work hot jobs, and always wear a sweatband, so if I can combine my two needs then bonus. These wont really cut it for heavy sweat days (but not many do), but they are fine for light to moderate sweat, really just better than anticipated.<br /><br />The multi pack offers lots of pretty mottled colors. Individually wrapped. Stitching looks good. I assume a cotton AND spandex blend. They are comfortable, and feel kind of cool on my head. They add no heat or weight. BONUS? they wrap around the wrist nicely, without adding bulk or weight. So now I have a sweatband, headband, or HAIR TIE whenever I need it.

I would love to see this offered in a multi pack.  Lightweight, and stays in place. I am shocked. The band is lined with a couple rows of silicone to help keep it from slipping around. I wear it so it touches my forehead. It isn't huge- I like that the band is on the more narrow side rather than taking up most of my head. I like options, and I like this for simply keeping my hair back and having some sweat absorbing ability. The material is super lightweight with some mesh for breathability.  I have a sweaty job, and was impressed with how well this kept the moisture from running down my face, as well as staying in place, and holding my hair in place.<br /><br /> I think terry cloth sweat bands are the best for soaking up heavy sweat, but I do happen to have a visor that has this same exact material, and it does a good job of grabbing sweat.",0.949,226,20.545454545454547,0.3,2.3747

I suppose they could be consumed direct from bag (I wouldnt), but these are diced and not flaked. Better to use freeze dried if you want a dehydrated product that you can munch on direct from bag.

"Big ole water bottle that holds 64 ounces (2 liters). Has sligh indent on two sides to help grasp it, also has a very sturdy paracord handle. Buy this for the sturdy attractive bottle to drink directly from and not necessarily for the straw. Nothing wrong with the product exactly, as I have seen this straw used in a variety of brands. It simply may or may not work well for you. I dont care for it, so I took it right out. Nice addition, but useless for me.<br /><br />The main aspects I like is the durable feel of the bottle, the robust color, the quality paracord handle, the snap tight lid, the wide opening (can stick hand in to clean with ease), good mouth spout-- very easy to draw from, locking cap, optional finger hook (hidden so well that it is easy to overlook. It pops up from top). And of course the times with motivational messages on one side, and the amount at each level on the other.<br /><br />I have filled my bottle, snapped it closed then took the chance on holding it upside down. It was risky behavior as I did this over my living room carpet rather than the kitchen sink. Thankfully the lid stayed firmly locked, and the seal is really good-- not a single drop escaped. Phew! So while I dont see my bottle being in the position, it is nice to know that I can toss it in a bag and not worry so much about it opening up too easily, if at all.<br /><br />I like this bottle a lot. I wanted to down rate based on the straw, then I decided that the dislike for the straw is more of a preference thing. This is not a ""built in straw"" type bottle. It just includes a flexible straw that if all goes well it pretty much stays in position when the cap is closed. Odd but it works.<br /><br />Been using this the better part of a week, I have loads of bottles and keep them in a few different spots in the house rather than carry just one around.

"I'm a big fan of chemical hand/foot/body warmers. I think they are super versatile, and a must have for vehicle emergency kits. Doesn't cost much to stock up for the season. The addition of a little bit of warmth in cold conditions can make all the difference in comfort and well being. I spend a lot of time outside in the winter, so stuff like this is a regular purchase for me.<br /><br />This pack of body warmers is typical in effectiveness and how it is used. Price is.. fair. I typically aim for about $1 per pack.<br /><br />Size wise, they are roughly 4""x 5"".  Stick them in your shirt, your hat, anywhere you need some direct gentle heat.<br />Don't open the packet until you need it. Expose the warmer pad to the air for a few moments before placement.<br /><br />The weather has not necessitated a need for these as of yet. I also haven't had any aches or pains that would require this, either. BUT, for sake of review I did open one and felt the warmth. Like I said, they are just like any other I have ever tried. They should be warm, not hot. It creates a gentle, low, radiating warmth.<br /><br />What I did do, and I hadn't done this before.. it that my 18 years old elderly cat was looking for an extra warm place to sleep. The weather isn't cold, but it has been much cooler than the long hot humid summer we had. I haven't winterized yet. So I got him out a super soft blanket and tucked this in underneath. He went from being curled up tight in a ball to being stretched out. He didn't have to try to make his own body heat. He seemed to love this! While I won't do this often since I have heating pads I need to get out for him, it occurred to me that it is a nifty item to have on hand for pet use too (so long as your pet isn't inclined to chew/tear at it). Could be extra handy during the occasional trip to the vet as something to help keep them warm and comfy while in their carrier. Even though we use blankets inside, I am sure the added cozy warmth would feel good.<br /><br />So far so good.

"I am reviewing the Jeff & Aimmy Cotton Vucket Hat in the color "" Black#990022"", which is gray with a black bow. I was supposed to receive the hat in black ( 00707_black), so that it was may come up under my review. I will include pics of the hat on.<br /><br />Before you select one, make sure to take a look at the sizing. There are TWO sizes available, Medium OR Large. There is no elastic, nor ability to adjust, so choose wisely.<br /><br />Medium fits 55-58CM (22.2""-22.8"");<br />Large fits 58-61CM (23.03""- 24.0"")  ----my head measures 23.75"", this fits very well.<br /><br />Despite that the product description states that the hat is adjustable, it is NOT. The only portion that is ""adjustable"" is the optional chin strap. On mine, it can be kept clipped on, or taken off. There is a toggle to make it tighter against the face, or allow it to be loose.<br /><br />The interior has what appears to be an elastic band, but it is not elastic. It's purpose is more like that of a sweat band or to provide some grip, but it doesn't not stretch. This will either fit, or it won't.<br /><br />I normally like Jeff & Aimmy products, and overall I like this too. I just want to see a cleaned up, more accurate description. (and what are with all the reviews for this product yet are for something not being sold here?)<br /><br />The material is soft, light. The brim is long but can be folded back some as needed.<br />The slit for the pony tail is subtle. So it will blend in when not in use. But to use it, is a little awkward as you will have to feed the pony tail through a narrow slit. Not bad though. Doable.<br /><br />I do appreciate that there are size offerings for larger heads. It is rare- extremely- that I find a womens hat that fits anything above 22.5"". MY cranium is 23.75"", so I can't wear most stuff. SO unless you have a bigger head like mine, you will most likely be wanting a medium. If your ""large"" is too big, then you ordered the wrong size as the size large is accurate (23.03""- 24.0""). It will just fit if your head it 24"". Might be snug. It fits mine just right at 23.75"". Or if your medium is too small.. then again, likely wrong size. selected. Either way, make sure you got what you ordered.<br /><br />I use sun hats (when I can find them in my size) a lot.  I prefer to avoid the sun. I keep it off my face and body, especially during the summer months. Between sun sensitive meds, rosacea, and just wanting added protection from UV rays, a sun hat is a great thing to have. Since I can add this to my list of companies that sell larger sized hats I will possibly be back to purchase more. I like the overall look (even if I did get something different than anticipated).",0.9838,675,20.454545454545453,0.0,1.89514
"This review is for the ""Snailman Outdoor Multifunctional Headwear, Running Magic Headband Hairband, Sports Fishing Riding Motorcycling Face Mask, UV Resistence Hiking Climbing Seamless Scarf Bandana"" in the color ""PURPLE LINES"".<br /><br />--I have been using this style of headwear for several years now. I like all the different configurations that a simple stretchy tube of material can offer. And that is really all that it is: a tube of stretchy material that can be used as a head band, sleep cap, a mask (just fold and add a filter), a pony tail holder, a wrist band, a neck band, eye/sleeping mask etc.  I have truly used it in several ways, most often as a means to keep my long crazy hair out of my face any time a day. It even work as a sweatband if needed (I still prefer an actual terry cloth sweatband, but this does work in a pinch as it helps keep sweat from dripping into eyes!).<br /><br />--No, it does not have hemmed edges. Not a single brand that I have tried that is strictly a tube of stretchy material has ever had that. It is unnecessary as these are not ever going to unravel. While I have not had this one long, I have had others from other brands for years, and they have been washed and worn many times over.<br /><br />--Folds down to nothing- takes up very little space. I could have a stack of these and they wont take up sizeable room.<br /><br />--This one has a wee bit less stretch than my others, so it is more likely to feel too tight after awhile on my huge head (nearly 23.5"" around).<br /><br />16.5"" length<br />  9.4"" width<br />The tube stretches with the width<br /><br />❤Material: 97% Polyester, 3% Elastane, UPF 50+, Stretchable, 100% Seamless<br />❤Size: 16.5 inch(42cm) X 9.7 inch(24cm); High stretchable to head circumference about 20.5-38.5inch,thickness is 0.3mm<br /><br />--product description states that these have SPF 50. I dont see anything about the material being treated, but the material itself (polyester) tends to naturally have a decent ultraviolet protection factor, especially with tighter weaves and darker fabrics.<br /><br />--Price wise, these are fair at around $8 a piece. The others that I tend to get are in a multi pack (5-8) for around $15. However, I see some singles for more than $8.. just going to say that this is exactly what I expect in terms of function and quality.",0.9176,560,43.07692307692308,0.1,1.90528
"I have a huge head, and thick hair.. so my options to buy hats are often quite limited, especially I want something that leans ""feminine"".  My head measures 23.25"", maybe closer to 23.5"". A lot of hats and such only accommodate up to 22""<br /><br />When I saw that this hat will fit up to a size 24"" head, AND there was an assortment of colors.. I decided to go for it.<br /><br />This review is for the ""Outdoor Fishing Hat with Neck Flap Wide Brim Adjustable Safari Cap"" in PINK.<br /><br />The pink color is more of a soft purple. Reminds me of black raspberry ice cream. The hat fits my head. I like that it has a wide brim and neck flap. Despite slathering myself with SPF every single day, I also use physical blocks such as big hats, visors, scarves. It is partly to avoid damaging and aging rays, but also because I am on medication that increases sensitivity, AND I tend to feel unwell being out in the sun. I am outside often and for mixed duration as I have two young labs to tend to.<br /><br />There is a mesh area on either side of the hat to allow for a cross breeze, or to vent heat. There is a way to tighten up the head part, as well as a spot to secure around the face.<br /><br />The one thing I do not care for is that the design is off. This may go completely unnoticeable to you (or it wont be a factor for you).  The chin strings (bolo style) to keep it from blowing off the head are permanently attached-- where many other styles have this designed to be taken off if one so desires, if they dont want dangling strings. And yet there is a spot with ""hardware"" where this could be done. See my pics!! Maybe it has been done prior, and this was incorrectly constructed. Or there was a design change and this was left on. I have no idea. That part has a little bit of nylon with plastic ring- situated on both sides of hat. This is normally where an open bolo would be attached (and be able to be unclipped). The ties that are permanently attached are more of a heavy shoelace feel-- again different than all other similar hats I have had. It's odd. Nothing I can do about it. Doesn't totally change my experience, or desire for another.. but I would prefer that it commit to using the same nylon straps, and either keep it as a permanent attachment and do away with the vestiges of any older style.. or get back to having the chin strap optional option.  AHHHH, I see.. maybe the extra spots are for the colors that come with a mesh face shield (in lieu of the attached neck flap)? Confusing, but that could be it.<br /><br />Anyway, I dont use the chin strap, but I would on a windy day (almost lost it off head in a parking lot on super breezy day). On a typical day, the hat other wise has been very secure on my head thanks to the head strap adjuster. I can walk around, twist around, bend over, sweat.. and not have it move at all-- which is great.",0.9816,678,24.214285714285715,1.3,2.68448
"This one size fits all (most?) fits my big head. I measure about 23.5"" around, and this fits so well. Feels like a dream. Very nice! This super light weight sun visor is all one piece with nothing to adjust. It just slips on. The material is stretchy. The interior is outlined with soft silicone dots to help hold it in place yet it doesn't grab wildly at my hair. The front interior is lined with a sweat absorbing material (I LOVE THAT SO MUCH). The visor overhang is super flexible yet sturdy.<br /><br />It is about as minimalist as I would want to go for a sun visor (trying to keep my 40 something skin in good shape for as long as possible), but it works. When I want total clear view, I just bend the visor into an upward position (see silly pic).<br /><br />While it feels a little snug on my head, it doesn't provoke a headache. It actually feels quite comforting and I don't want to take it off when I come inside. It just feels good on. I like that I can wear it with my hair down, but usually I have my hair up when I head outside. It stays in place. I can bend over and it doesn't slip off. Since it is a soft material (but with structure, no worries) it can be folded and stored in your bag if need be.<br /><br />It really does feel like nothing while wearing it.

Lots of ideas for small, dense sturdy bags packed with beans!<br /><br />But yes, ultimately these are meant for the Corn Hole/ bean bag toss game. And for that you want material that can withstand being tossed across the way landing on a board, or grass.. and so they need to be durable and water resistant. These have that quality. They will work, and should hold up. I have only been playing around with them for less than a week, but they seem fine. Here are details on what you will be purchasing:<br /><br />What you get: 8 Corn Hole bean bags in durable canvas fabric for using with your Corn Hole game board.<br />4: red and white stripes<br />4: blue with white stars<br />All in an American flag design drawstring bag of same material. Water resistant; good stitching.<br />Measures: 6"" X 6""<br />Weighs: 14-16 Ounces<br /><br />It is summer festive with its American flag design. If you don't have a corn hole board, you will need to acquire one (An elevated, slightly slanted board with a six inch hole in it to toss these bags into). You can use these for other purposes too as bean bags are simply fun to play with. I just like tossing things- making baskets- so I keep a couple of pails outside on different levels so I can just play whenever I want.",0.9952,549,27.45,0.0,2.29856
"The information provided in the written part of the product description needs to line up with the pictures as well as what is actually sent. It is NOT THE SAME as what you read or see. There are some spots that are the same, and many that are different. I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS based on the mixed information.<br /><br />HERE IS WHAT I RECEIVED:<br />--A smooth, zippered soft ""hard shell"" case (firm but flexible. Think of a cheap sunglass case). This is not at all what is pictured NOR described in the product information. What is pictured is a totally different material. It may not make a difference if you are just looking for some supplies, OR it may make all the difference if you are looking for a particular container as well as supplies. With this as the description, ""Durable & Portable Tactical Molle Pouch】ETROL mini Survival Gear is ultralight, compact and portable with a Velcro strap system compatible with MOLLE so that it can be hooked to the backpack, belt or other. It offers large compartments and plenty of room to add your own equipment, including a special phone pocket and an emergency pen slot"" NOPE NOPE NONE OF THIS. Just a smooth zippered shell. No means to use it as part of MOLLE system, no extra compartments or special pockets or place to have a pen. They are describing a product even different than shown, and even further off from what I received.<br /><br />--The product description also states (as of 3/31/20) that, ""【Quick Access & Top Quality Durable Supplies】The Survival Gear Kit includes the most popular outdoor survival necessities: 3-mode Tactical Flashlight, black stainless steel Tactical Military Knife, Fire Starter, Compass of the military class, a Multi-Function Tool Card, a loudly Whistle with 120db, Emergency Blankets which can retain 90% of body heat and more. Being customized and uniquely tested, our Survival First Aid Kit is designed to prepare you well in case of outdoor activities "" NOPE!! Plastic whistle and emergency blanket, yes. Flashlight, military knife, fire starter, compass, Multi function tool card.. NOPE.  I actually didn't expect this, but for it to state this in the description? False advertisement!<br /><br />Kit is described as measuring 7.5"" x 5.1"" x 2""<br />MY KIT measures roughly, 6.5"" x 4.75"" x 2.5""<br /><br />--The product description DOES seem to accurately state the medical supplies portion, ""【FDA Approved & Professional Treatment Supplies】This First Aid Kit contains the most important first aid supplies for various treatments on the market. Buckle Tourniquet, PBT conforming bandage, Tourniquet, non-woven tape, first aid scissors, plastic tweezers, sterile gauze, a lot of alcohol swabs, cotton swabs, PE adhesive bandages, and safety pins, to stop massive bleeding, dressing or disinfection of wounds nd more, which will come in handy in case of unforeseen events"". To see what you are getting, I can say that it 100% matches up to the product description PICTURE of the supplies. ((NOT THE CASE, though))<br /><br />Furthermore,<br />--The kit I have has a fairly useless first aid manual. It is labeled as being by ""Firstar"" (as are the medical packaging), and is visually messy as well as minimally informative. Consider it non essential and add your own emergency steps. As for the contents, again, it is as described according to the product description and pictures. YET If compared to the information provided on the manual, it would not come close to being the same items. For what it is worth, what comes in this kit according to the product description picture is much better.<br /><br />--Other plusses include that I am pleased with all that is in there, how well it is packed, how easy it is to access the items as well as how surprisingly easy it was to get everything back into the container.<br /><br />--However I take issue with the misinformation between what is described and what I received. Even if they totally took out the part on all the tactical goodies that is supposed to be in it, and just focused on the medical.. then there would still be the problem of the TOTALLY DIFFERENT case than what is pictured and described. The soft/hard shell zippered case is OK enough, and would be FINE if it were pictured and described as such. But if you are expecting a MOLLE bag/attach capable (that's a big thing), then this would be hugely disappointing.<br /><br />--So overall, I can not in good conscience recommend a product when it is so far off from what is pictured and described. I have no idea what it costs, and you better believe that a MOLLE style/attachment capable bag is worth more than this soft/hard shell.<br /><br />--I would include pictures but the photo/video  uploader that Amazon usually has in the reviews has been missing for about a week now. If I see that it comes back up, I will be sure to show you the case I have, then you can see how different it is.  Again, case is a firm smooth soft shell with zipper. Bright red and labeled, ""first aid kit""<br /><br />If the product description (plus pic of the container) changes, then I can edit this as is reasonable.<br /><br />Again-- the actual contents according to the picture/graphic is correct. The case is not. The description of the case and other items is entirely wrong. The list of items this kit contains according to the useless weird manual is also wrong, BUT the items included here are better. SO do with this information as you will. I hope it helped you today. Despite the errors in information, it is possible that what I described happens to be exactly what you are looking for. My 1 star rating could be your 5 :)",0.9922,1203,30.075,0.3,0.7876599999999999
"Great water bottle. Not my first of this style, but definitely my first that has an infusion strainer. If you don't want to use it for that, the strainer pops right out. The water bottle is great as is. It holds 32 ounces, has a flip top lid with a locking cap (wonderful for on the go- peace of mind that your water wont leak all over your bag accidentally), can drink from the spout or twist entirely off to drink from wide mouth.  The durable wrist strap circles the whole bottle and moves with you. Easy to clean, and easy to keep track of water intake if that is your thing.<br /><br />A water bottle brush is included. Directions state that nothing about this bottle is dishwasher safe. Even without the brush it is easy to clean, though the brush is nice to have on hand too.<br /><br />I never thought the time markers would be of interest to me since my drink of choice happens to be water. But, I do find myself taking a peek at the time and looking at my bottle to see how far I have come along, and whether I need to catch up or not. I automatically fill my bottle in the morning, and I usually refill by noon or so. Usually I am ahead of schedule, but even so it is simply nice to know!<br /><br />I find it to be a durable bottle. I am not easy on my bottles, and I am pleased to have this in my collection.",0.9961,309,23.76923076923077,0.1,2.32883
"Might be my favorite 32 ounce water bottle. Besides the water consumption reminders printed on the bottle, there are aspects to it that are very important to me when choosing a water bottle (lots of trial and error over the years!) and some preferences. This one is hitting on all of them. Here is a list of what I look for and additional thoughts on this bottle.<br /><br />1. Holds a fair amount of water. 32 ounces. Enough to make me feel secure in knowing I have a decent amount of hydration available to me.<br /><br />2. Sturdy bottle; leak proof. This bottle is made of BPA free ""co polyester"" plastic, and it feels like it could withstand an accidental drop. When tipped over, or turned upside down no water leaks from it.<br /><br />3. Locking cap. If you have ever had a water bottle open upon the contents of your bag, you will forever and always want a securely locking cap. This has it. Also, this cap is easy to unlock and flick open with use of one hand.<br /><br />4. Straw. I have a nearly identical bottle that has a spout instead of straw. Awesome bottle, but the addition of a straw makes this bottle even better. I was concerned at first when I saw how slim the straw is (similar in diameter to a typical drinking straw where as a lot of other strawed bottles have ones that are more similar in diameter to a smoothie straw). Once I started pulling water from it, my concerns were for naught. The water comes up quickly, easily, and fully from the flip nozzle mouth piece. It is GREAT. I can take in a lot of water quickly. If I didn't want to use the built in straw, and instead wanted to chug from the bottle directly, know that it has a..<br /><br />5. Wide mouth opening. Fill up the bottle with water, room to add lots of ice cubes, etc. Can chug easily from the wide mouth if you want to. There is a band of material around the cap that has texture which makes the cap easy to grip and unscrew- great for hot sweaty days. Also, looks nice.<br /><br />6. Nice feature: coordinating wrist strap that is on a collar. This is a big deal since it means it isn't locked into just one direction. It moves with you, allows bottle to be used while in your hand, either hand. Also is removable if having a strap isn't your thing.<br /><br />7. At 11' x 2.8"", this Large capacity bottle is easy to fit in some if not most car cup holders. Since it is so secure in terms of being leak proof, I find that I don't even need to use my trucks cup holder.. but it does make me realize it will be a good water bottle for when I am on a piece of equipment that has a water bottle holder.<br /><br />8. Size of the 32 ounce bottle is easy to hold and handle. It isn't so wide that it takes two hands.<br /><br />9. Mentioning this separately- the wide mouth makes it easier to hand clean. I use a long handled scrubber. I haven't run it through dish washer because I prefer to hand wash my water bottles. Also wide mouth makes it easier to stuff fruit in it and clean it out after.<br /><br />10. Time and Consumption indicator. I drink water because I like it. After I have some coffee, I tend to just drink water all day. I do a lot of unhealthy things, but for some reason drinking water has never really been an issue. Still, it is easy to slack off or simply forget. I know I can just look at my water bottle and see that I drank some and need to drink more, but it is also kinda fun to have the visual reminder printed directly on the bottle. For example. Its 2 pm. and I filled it and started drinking it at 8am, but my water level is still at the 10 am spot-- welll that info may be just enough to get me to get to sipping. But even if I never used it for that purpose.. this is a fantastic water bottle. So far zero leaks, cracks, or any other concerns.<br /><br />Their pictures within their product description did a great job on showing all the features, but I added a few of my own anyway.<br /><br />Additional notes:<br />--my water bottle had zero smell when it arrived. I washed it prior to use anyway.<br />--I filled it up and let it sit in a bowl for 24 hours. There was zero leaking from anywhere.<br />--I dropped it on floor full of water, and it did not break,. HOWEVER, depending on flooring, angle of drop, and even amount of water.. anything is possible. I was just curious how it would handle a drop and luckily mine stayed intact. I hope I didn't weaken it.<br />--My straw is amazing, and I can draw from it without effort. I can basically chug my water even faster with this straw.<br /><br />I am currently using this, and will continue to do so. I am truly enjoying it. Since it has only seen a couple of weeks of daily use, I will be sure to come back and let you know if I experience ANYTHING worth sharing. Right now, I am loving it and recommend giving it a try.",0.9994,1153,18.901639344262296,0.0,2.29982
"Fantastic towel! Bagail offers several sizes to suit your needs. Mine is the MEDIUM sized which is 24""x48"". The towel has a small zipped pocket in the corner. Might seem silly, but for anyone who spends time at the gym, it is great to have a spot to stick a membership card, a phone, or keys-- as well as be able to wipe off equipment. Of course use it for anything you want, or for nothing at all! If I were camping or using a dorm shower, I would stick a bottle of shampoo or soap in there.<br /><br />The towel also has a large loop tab making it possible to hang up on a hook.<br /><br />The towel comes in a small, silky nylon bag (that may or may not be rip stop material). The zipper is solid, and the bag also has a handle. One corner of the bag is mesh, allowing breath-ability and quick drying. Towel folds up easily and slips in without struggle.<br /><br />Bag and towel came with a D ring, for additional hanging needs. I think if I were hiking/camping etc and had a back pack with me, I would use the D-ring to attach the towel bag to outside of my backpack for further use in drying, or ease of use.<br /><br />All in all very light weight and compact. LOVE IT!!<br /><br />What am I using it for that I am so excited about?... I personally have it packed in my dog bag. It is PERFECT for drying off wet, dirty labs. So much better than a terrycloth towel. A great item to add to the car/truck whether for dog use or for people use- ya never know.",0.994,359,21.11764705882353,0.2,2.3582
"This 2.25 gallon bucket is handy! I found it as I was considering options for a temporary water dish for my dogs. I knew I wanted a handle, but I didn't want a pail, nor anything too deep. I wouldn't be keeping water in it all day, just for super hot days when we go out to play. I figured to put some water in it and carry it outside, then dump it before we came back in. Our play sessions are anywhere from 15- 60 minutes depending on their level of interest to sniff, chase each other, play fetch, etc so I wanted to have some fresh water whenever they want it- especially for upcoming hot summer days. And be easy for me to make happen for them.<br /><br />So when I saw this, I guessed it would work for my needs. BPA free, durable, has 2 sturdy handles, wide enough to allow two dogs to drink from, shallow enough that they don't have to have their faces inside a bucket, and collapsible for ease of storage when not in use. I was worried that they would accidentally collapse it when they drink from it, but so far so good. I just fill it about half way, then carry it outside with us. Sometimes they take a drink, sometimes not. The main thing for me is that they had that option, and it was clean water rather than running over to the creek or over to their little pool.<br /><br />I imagine I will get another one for my own use around the house. I really like that it collapses for storage. It is just one of those things that are super useful. I see that there are larger sizes, so I may consider that for myself. Nic3e product!",0.9927,351,21.9375,2.0,2.89781
"I like the idea. If you are using this for home, office, hotel, on the run. For those applications you are likely to have food that doesn't need to be heated or you will have access to a microwave. Maybe even for camping, or day hike, so long as you are not looking to also cook with it- as it is not meant for flame or direct heat. For that, I prefer to pack a metal bowl and cup set.<br /><br />There are two ""plates"" at .75"" deep, and a ""bowl"" (or lid) that measures 1.5"" deep. The three items stack.<br /><br />There are 2 eating utensils. Spoon on one side, and a combo Knife and Fork on the other. The spoon and fork work fine. The knife is best for items you want to cut that don't need a lot of work to get it done. Softer, easier items are best.<br /><br />There are two cups. The base is a soft silicon that smooshes up inside. The lid/cap is attached.  It flicks open easily, yet doesn't snap tight (too bad). Comfortable enough to drink from it with cap open, or can keep it closed and drink from the small opening.<br /><br />The cups don't stand well on their own empty. They do fine with liquid inside.  One of my pictures has the pink cup leaning up against other stuff because it is empty. The green one is standing fine, but I have water poured inside.<br /><br />Everything stacks and fit together nicely. Needs harness to hold it all together.<br /><br />Nylon with mesh, draw string bag is just big enough to fit the stacked together and harnessed items.<br /><br />I tried this set at home with my lunch, so I could see how everything performed. I like the look of it, I like the materials used. I think this set would do well with an additional lid/bowl so there would be 1:1 for each set. Especially as a cup and a utensil fits nice in each plate, it would be nice to have an additional lid for one of the sets. This would allow the set to be parted out (say one for work, one for car) and/or as well as allow each user to have the exact same thing. I don't know why it wasn't arranged to be like that.<br /><br />I do like the cups, overall, and am considering toss one in my purse.",0.9919,523,22.73913043478261,0.7,2.10757
"I bought a few of these primarily for use in Bug Out Bag/Get Home Bag- basically a pack I keep loaded in my truck. I have one for my husbands car, too. Then I keep one with my daily carry all bag. I love that they can just clip on to the bag with the included carabiner. I like this better than the basic life straw, as it makes it super functional for daily use (This is a GREAT water bottle for filling it up with tap water from places other than home!!!). Also makes it more functional when you are in a situation that really does need it. Lots of great, super descriptive reviews tackle how to use it, and little helpful hints, so I will keep my review super short. Just wanted to pop in and give my recommendation on such a worth while item to have.<br /><br />It makes for an awesome, thoughtful gift for anyone. Buy this, and some other life preserving items (mylar blanket, chemical hand warmers, energy bars, etc).",0.9945,208,23.11111111111111,0.1,2.32835
"This review is for the Black White stripe 2 pair lot in L/XL. 20-20mmg compression<br /><br />Attractive, functional socks that have been effective in reducing edema in lower legs, especially ankle area. They go on easily, fit well, and I love that there are multiple designs and quantity packs available.<br /><br />The socks are of quality and effective (5 stars!) BUT I have to take one star away for stitching inside. It isn't noticeable putting them on, or while wearing them, but when the socks are taken off the socks leave at least two obvious indented impression vertical/up and down the legs where the sock has extra stitching/material inside. Not so much stitching as woven material overlap? I'll try to add to this review with a picture soon.<br />Maybe it only affects the Black White Stripe socks.<br />It does not stop me from wearing them, and it wouldn't stop me from purchasing more from this brand.

"I like to be prepared. I keep several pair in my truck, in my purse, and a few in my house. The winter temps had recently dropped into single digits. Even with layered socks and decent boots, it was not enough to keep the icy sensation from reaching my toes. With the addition of a pair of &#34;Little Hotties Adhesive Toe Warmers&#34;, my feet were comfortable for several hours. I barely felt the bulk of the product. They even worked when I needed to wear a pair of dress shoes.<br /><br />Definitely a great product to have for days when you need some consistent heat. I have have had bouts of Raynauds Syndrome in the past. A great way to keep the purple tingling icy toes (or fingers) at bay is to keep the temperature regulated in those regions. That means not getting too cold, and not heating them up too fast. Coming and going inside and out, Toe Warmers help to maintain the temperature, and simply feels good.",0.9776,204,18.545454545454547,0.2,2.3532800000000003
"Sure you can turn the bucket over for a seat, but what about the stuff inside? Or perhaps the stuff hanging off the sides? Why dump it out to have a seat? I thought about this as I bought a 5 gallon bucket and added a canvas tool bucket caddy to wrap around it. Figured it would be an awesome 'all in one go-to bucket' for gardening, and another one for plumbing, or whatever. Maybe a little &#34;on the go&#34; party bucket--always have some drink/snacks and a place to sit at a backyard barbeque. So many ideas forming just with the addition of a piece of plastic. That is when I made purchase of the worthwhile addition of the padded bucket lid. For ten bucks, you get a securely fitting bucket lid that doubles as a decent seat. Lightly padded, it adds a *tiny* bit of cushion and strength to an already sturdy lid. It's no lazy-boy recliner, but it sure feels nice to take a load off. Really, can't go wrong with this product.",0.98,209,17.416666666666668,2.5,3.044

"I bought this air mattress expressly to use in place of an exercise mat on the floor.  That’s why I gave it five stars.<br /><br />This “twin” Air Mattress is best for children, due to its narrow width and short length. It is absolutely not the size of a traditional twin bed. I have a twin bed in our spare room so I’m sure of this. I’m 5‘3“ tall and have only about 2 inches to spare at the bottom of the air mattress.

He loves this cup and his coffee is hot.  Thanks Stanley for another winning idea!,0.8832,72,18.0,0.0,2.26496

"This is roomy and held up well in a rainstorm while fishing.  Set-up and breakdown were easy enough with my 13 year nephew who is on the small side.  It was also pretty light for him to carry.  I liked being able to zip and close the windows for a breeze. There are design issues though.  The way you have to zip and unzip the doors, rain will inevitably get in and pool on the tent floor if anyone has to go in or out.  Also, getting the tent packed back into the bag proved a huge hassle and the bag ripped with very little pressure.  Don't forget to let it air dry first or you will have a mildewed mess the next time you try and use it.",0.8409,140,17.5,0.2,1.5122700000000002

"I just bought this product so I could ride around the neighborhood with my daughter.  The first few trial runs wre great, and she loved being in the seat.

ALL FOUR bolts holding the seat in place had come off during our ride.  Had she fell backwards instead of forwards she would have fallen onto the pavement in the middle of the road we were crossing.

"I was weary of ordering an inflatable SUP, however after countless hours of research I landed on this ROC SUP. I am so pleased with my  decision and am extremely grateful for the video resources that showed the board in action, and not just calm settings but the displaying the durability of the board.<br /><br />Once I got, I used the manual pump to inflate to determine the level of effort and much to my surprise it was not near as difficult as I was expected but rather was easy to inflate. I followed the directed PSI and did feel like I was over pumping it the first time but stoped to read if that was normal and confirm that was :)<br /><br />Once I got it on the water, my daughter (9) and I easily got on the board with PLENTY of room! The board is very stable and neither of us had trouble launching, paddling, or docking. My kid even transferred vessels on the water- off the SUP and into her dads kayak and then back again. No topples!<br /><br />Another mention for you is the sturdiness that this board provides. As an inflatable I am always wondering if it will pop, however have been so pleased to see no wear and tear here! I paddled over a rather large branch / tree that I didn’t notice under the surface of the water until it was too late but turns out.. wasn’t too late. I hit it but the board was perfectly fine!! I also let my 9yr help me carry it (she likes to help) and she had lost grip of the back and dropped it on the short where there was gravel. No problems there either, not even a scuff.<br /><br />Lastly, the bag that is comes with to carry is TOP NOTCH!! I love it and can carry the board and store it with ease. Wonder if they make a hiking bag as good as this carrying bag?! If not- they should!  The padding and straps are perfect!<br /><br />I am likely going to buy another one for friends to go out with me as well since this has proven to be so effective! So pleased with this board and grateful for the company!!",0.9976,455,26.764705882352946,6.1,4.12928

This was easy to assemble and works great once it's put together. I did it alone with no help. I saw other reviews and added a board between the ceiling and the pole because others complained it left a mark on their ceiling. It was sturdy for months until one day it slipped slightly so it seems to loosen over time. That's why I didn't give 5 stars. Other than that it's a great product. My boyfriend was able to get on and swing around with no issues as well as hold his whole body up sideways. Seems sturdy enough.,0.722,112,14.0,0.3,1.9066

"It takes 2 people to get the elastic bands on. Not so easy to assemble but worth it. The bounce pad is extremely firm and gives an incredible bounce. This is a fantastic trampoline for fitness. I also bought a cheaper brand for my kids. I would go with this model over the other one. It has a far superior bounce and you can just roll it away for easy storage. This trampoline is worth the extra money in the bounce it delivers. Going with a model that holds more weight is best. This model holds up to 450 pounds. It also does not stretch to the floor when you bounce. The pad stays firm giving you the support you need. It is also very quiet!! It does not rattle or make noise.

"THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Looks pretty. My girl likes the looks of it, likes the led lights in the dark.<br />* The build is solid. Feels sturdy, feels high quality.<br />* It's pretty fast at 7.5 mph.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Nothing on the handle bar. There is no hand brakes, no hand throttle either. Everything is accomplished by your feet.<br />* No speed levels. There is only 1 speed, and it's 7.5 mph.<br />* Cannot fold to stow away.<br />* Cannot use scooter as a traditional manual scooter. Because the buttons are on the base, you will be forced to use the electric feature when both your feet are on the base.<br /><br />THE MAIN PROBLEM:<br />--------------------------<br />* It's advertised for 6 to 12 yrs, but I think it's a little difficult for kids in the lower end of that range. My girl is 6, and this did not work out for her on our first day. It's going to take some time. The throttle system is all in the feet. You have to step on the first button, then you push with your other leg to get the scooter to go a certain speed, then you have to step on the back button to initiate the throttle. That's it... you're off! It's pretty fast, and to brake, you need to release that back button and place the same back foot on the plastic guard above the back wheel. It's a lot for a 6 yr old to consume, especially at a high speed. They will panic. But for bigger kids who can get the hang of it quickly, they might be disappointed at the 7.5 mph limitation. So this scooter is too much for beginners, yet too little for advanced users.<br /><br />THE BETTER OPTION ON AMAZON:<br />------------------------------------------<br />* I would spend a little extra and get the Ninebot E10. That scooter can be folded away, has hand brakes, hand throttle, and 3 speed levels. It's lowest level is 6.2 miles and tops at 10 mph. There is no feet coordination to remember. You just peddle the scooter to a certain speed, just like you have to with this Gotrax, but instead of having to worry about where you place your other foot, the throttle is on the right handle, and you simply press down with your thumb. On the left handle is a brake, not only that, it still has a brake on the guard of the back wheel just like this Gotrax. It is much easier to learn for a 6 yr old, and you can learn it at a slower speed of 6.2 mph. When they do get the hang of it, they can go up to 10 mph, and not limited to 7.5 mph. Lastly, with the Ninebot, you can use it as a manual scooter since all controls are on the handle. It would be your child's choice to use the electric component or not. If they're not ready yet, just don't press down on the throttle with the thumb, and simply use it as a normal scooter. You do not have that choice with this Gotrax since all controls are built on the base. Once both feet are on the base, you have no choice but to use the throttle.

"THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Much easier than doing sit-ups, in my opinion.<br />* Your whole body will feel tight including your arms and shoulders because you're lifting your own weight.<br />* There are 4 incline levels so you gradually increase your level as you get better.<br />* There are many similar machines on the market, some have individual left and right rollers. The rollers on this version are all attached to one plate, so you have to pull yourself up with both legs.<br />* Very light weight. Easy to put away.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />-----------<br />* Not necessarily a bad, but you cannot pull up with individual legs. The rollers are all attached to one plate. I've read that the individual rollers are easier for beginners. We have both versions, and to be honest, I don't think it's a big deal. Lifting with one leg at a time is so easy that I think you'd be doing yourself a disservice. My wife is very weak, and that was the reason I got her the individual roller version, but she feels no resistance or burn, so she prefers pulling up with both legs. If you want to really push yourself, do not get the individual roller version. This version will suffice. 5-Stars",0.9233,289,26.272727272727277,0.2,2.33699
"THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* I've never done this much ab workout in my life. I hate sit-ups, but this machine.. I can do!<br />* Your whole body will feel tight including your arms and shoulders because you're lifting your own weight.<br />* There are 4 incline levels so you gradually increase your level as you get better.<br />* There are many similar machines on the market, this version has two separate rollers. So this is potentially easier for those who find this machine difficult. Because you can simply pull one leg at a time to start. But to be honest, it's so easy it's pointless. You'll achieve nothing by pulling up one leg at a time.<br />* The sensor to count is on the left roller. So if you go one leg at a time, it only counts after you've pulled your left leg.<br />* Very light weight. Easy to put away.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />-----------<br />* Nothing.

One of the biggest inconveniences when lifting at home is changing your weights for different exercises.  In the gym you just walk up to the weight rack and pick up the weight amount you want.  Now, all I have to do at home is twist on or off the amount of weight I want.  So simple!!!  This saves so much time and frustration when transitioning to different exercise.  For example:  you can curl more the your tricep workouts.  Just change your weight amount in seconds!!!  Another great feature I like is that the weights are small in circumference for even form and keeping the weights close to your body.

"I am a middle aged marathon runner. I have been having some issues with my heel so I got this treadmill with the hope that it will be less impact than running outside. I've found it to be a good machine with a nice running surface and an intuitive interface.<br /><br />The running surface is 20 inches by 60 inches. It's a very large and comfortable surface. The surface absorbs your foot strikes very well, but it is not bouncy. There is also good traction on the running surface so there's no danger of slipping even when you start to sweat.<br /><br />The assembled weight is 280 pounds, so this is a very sturdy and stable unit. I was able to assemble it with the help of my wife. I'd recommend that you have a space cleared out for it when the delivery people arrive. The closer they can put the treadmill to where you want it, the better. Overall assembly was easy, but it took a couple of hours. The treadmill comes with all the tools you need to put it together. The manual is easy to follow.<br /><br />Once the treadmill has been put together, you can separate it into two components with relative ease. You just have to detach the console cable and remove the console structure with a few screws. This will allow you to move it without completely disassembling the whole unit.<br /><br />There are buttons on either side of the touch screen. On the right are the buttons for treadmill speed, and on the left are the buttons for incline. There are also thumb buttons on the console so you can increase and decrease your speed at smaller increments. The unit also includes an emergency shut off that connects to your shirt with a clip.<br /><br />When you select a speed, the treadmill accelerates to that speed relatively fast. I actually like this feature because it helps you get up to pace quickly if you're trying to run an interval.<br /><br />The console is basically a computer, so it will likely have to download some updates the first time you turn it on. You'll also have to connect it to your Wi-Fi. There are a wide variety of workouts available on the console. I like the feature that allows you to watch videos of exotic settings as you run.<br /><br />When I first tried to make a profile, the unit failed to send me a confirmation email. I believe the reason was that my password was only 6 characters instead of the required 8. I tried again after troubleshooting on the web page and didn’t have further issues. Once you create a profile, you have to do a 15 minute test workout so the console can start creating individualized workouts.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that you're unable to watch Netflix or Amazon prime unless you have a premium membership to the app. However, this unit has plenty of very nice features.<br /><br />Overall, this is a high quality treadmill. It's comfortable to run on and the speed is consistent. I haven’t experienced any unexpected accelerations or decelerations. The incline feature allows you to challenge yourself, and the workouts are fun. This is a good product for getting into shape.",0.9967,664,22.89655172413793,1.6,2.37901

This rope is very simple and works extremely well.<br /><br />It comes with plenty of cord and it's easy to adjust the length. All you have to do is slide the handle down the cord and adjust the buckle and casing to fit your needs. The directions advised cutting the extra cord, but I was able to fold it and stuff it back into the handle instead. That way I can lengthen the rope as my kids grow.<br /><br />This is a nice product with comfortable handles. The rope does not leave any marks on your floors.

"This is a good pack of lightweight meals. Instead of mixing them in the bag, you have to mix them in a separate bowl. This strikes me as a more efficient way of preparing your meals because each of these meal packs is much smaller than brands that require you to mix in the original bag. I'd prefer to carry a single bowl than a bunch of extra packaging material.<br /><br />You pour the contents into a bowl and mix it with hot water, then you allow it to sit for 8-10 minutes. The flavors are very good and even my kids enjoyed the meals. I found that a single pack made a good lunch and provided enough energy for hiking or performing other activities.

The jacket has two front pockets and a high quality zipper. This is a terrific, high performance athletic top that looks great.",0.9912,132,22.0,0.0,2.29736
"Every cyclist needs to carry a portable pump and an extra tube with them at all times. If you happen to get a flat ten miles away from your home, you are out of luck. You can't try to ride on a flat tire because it's dangerous and you'll ruin both the tire and the rim. It's a much better practice to have a high quality pump.<br /><br />This Winningo portable pump is a perfect choice. The gauge takes out the guesswork and you can use this pump to get back to your regular tire pressure and continue with your ride. The valve can easily be converted between Presta and Schrader. The valve is attached to a rubber tube which makes inflation a lot more convenient. Many portable pumps attach directly to the valve stem, and if you're not careful you can accidentally snap off the stem when you inflate. The rubber tube makes that unfortunate outcome virtually impossible.<br /><br />This portable pump is designed like a mini floor pump. It stands upright and a foot pedal flips out for stability. This allows you to pump up your tire with the assistance of body weight. You can easily inflate a tire to its recommended pressure with this pump, but the pump is compact enough to fit on a clip beside a water bottle cage on the downtube. This is a great product that will ensure you are well equipped to get back out on the road if you ever have a flat during a ride.",0.9453,290,22.307692307692307,0.2,2.3435900000000003

"I am an avid cyclist and I was pleased to get this stationary bicycle. I prefer using a stationary bicycle to a trainer for my road bicycle because you sweat a lot when riding indoors and that's not good for your drivetrain.

The bladder opening has a flat handle that lies flush with the bladder when it is full, but keeps the bladder stable as you fill it.<br /><br />I like the variety of pockets on the front of the vest that are perfect for chews, candy-bars, bananas, or whatever you prefer. It's nice to have food in easy reach while you're out getting a workout. The drink tube has a shut-off valve next to the nozzle so you don't have to worry about leakage when you put your hydration pack in your car.<br /><br />The back of the pack has a variety of packets and a compartment large enough to store a lightweight jacket. This is an efficient hydration vest with such good weight distribution that you hardly notice you're wearing it when you go for a run. It's perfect for athletes of every level and will make all your workouts more enjoyable.",0.9924,219,31.285714285714285,0.0,2.29772
"This is a really nice floor pump with smooth action and an easy to read pressure dial at the bottom. The handle is wide enough to make the pump easy to use, and the item features a durable construction. The valve is compatible with both Schrader and Presta valves. Many bicycles require a tire pressure of around 80 to 100 pounds and fully inflating your tires increases your efficiency and leads to a better ride. This pump allows you to top off your tire pressure and get on your way as conveniently as possible.",0.8588,100,20.0,0.0,2.25764
"This 24 ounce bottle is ruggedly made with an attractive overall appearance. It keeps liquids cold for up to twelve hours and hot for up to 6 hours. The bottle does not leak and the hole at the top has a locking cap to prevent accidental spills. There is no squeeze nozzle, so you can pour liquid from this bottle which makes it a good camping option. There is a convenient finger loop on the cap that is made from durable plastic which makes the bottle easy to carry. The bottle is pretty deep, so you need a brush with a long handle for cleaning. This is a great hydration product and is perfect for gym bags.",0.9645,126,18.0,0.0,2.2893499999999998
"This is a convenient, tasty, and easy to make packet of camp food. All you have to do is rip open the packet, pour in boiling water, and wait for about nine minutes. Be sure to dig through the freeze dried food and remove the Oxygen scavenger before you add the water.<br /><br />Also, be careful when you open the packet because there is no internal bag and you don't want to accidentally spill the contents. The beef stew flavor is pleasing and there is a good variety of meat and vegetables. I ate mine with a couple bread rolls and the result was a very satisfying meal. These are great for trips, or for an afternoon adventure with the kids.",0.9666,141,23.5,0.3,2.3799799999999998
"I got this packet of camp food to try out with my seven and nine year old daughters. I wanted to see how they would respond to the flavor and they absolutely loved it. They also enjoyed mixing up the dinner. Preparation is easy, all you have to do is pour boiling water into the bag and let it sit. The instructions call for 1 and 1/3 cups of water, but I didn't measure and the food turned out fine.<br /><br />Take caution when you open the bag because the freeze dried food is not contained in a separate wrapping. If you aren't careful, you could spill the contents. Also, you have to be sure to remove the oxygen absorbing packet before you add water. Once the food is prepared, the flavor is very good.<br /><br />These packets have a shelf life until 2049. It's a great option for camping, or just for having a novelty meal with your kids.",0.9458,192,21.33333333333333,0.5,2.43374
"This is a nice water shirt that will help keep you comfortable and prevent sunburn while you're out on a lake, river, or beach. It is a quick-dry, lightweight shirt that is made from 100% polyester. Note that the shirt is not made out of swimsuit material, but is more like a quick-dry running shirt. The material is a little bit stretchy but is not nearly as elastic as Lycra or Spandex. The colors are attractive and the shirt fits true to size. If you are between sizes, you should select the larger shirt here so it's easier to pull on and off when it becomes damp. You can kind of see through the material so it's best to wear a swimsuit beneath it. The shirt is nice to swim in, and provides a more modest, yet still attractive look. This would be a great option for people who perform aqua yoga. If you spend a lot of time near the water, this is a great item for your gear bag.",0.9937,193,19.3,0.3,1.98811
"These are a very nice set of sport sunglasses. I do a lot of cross-country skiing, running, and cycling, and it's nice to have good eye protection. High speeds are not uncommon when cycling or skiing, and you don't want to get hit by a bug or a thrown stone. These glasses offer a nice shield that completely covers your eyes. I like that the lens is large enough to prevent light from seeping in from around the edges.<br /><br />The glasses are very comfortable with a rubber nose piece that keeps them firmly in place. The glasses are very lightweight, and come with a protective case, lanyard, and lens-cleaning bag. No matter what your sport, these sunglasses are a high quality option at a very affordable price.",0.9476,152,21.714285714285715,0.1,2.3142799999999997
"These are a nice pair of show shoes that can be used by kids, or adults in mild conditions. Show shoeing is a terrific sport that allows you to get out into nature. It also provides a tremendous workout and your children will be worn out and calm after exploring.<br /><br />The 19"" measurement is from the inside of the frame, the point to point measurement is closer to 20"". These are a perfect, nimble size for lightweight individuals. The binding includes a clip for the heel, and a tooth binder across the top of the foot that is inserted and ratcheted tight. To release the top binding you push the white button and the strap slides right out.<br /><br />Also included is a nice carrying bag that is large enough to fit the snow shoes and leave additional space. Every kid deserves to play around on a pair of snow shoes. It becomes a hobby for many and a passion for some. This is a great set of affordable starter snow shoes.",0.9774,202,22.444444444444443,0.1,2.3232199999999996
"These are a great pair of winter pants for outdoor fun. The fleece lining makes them nice and warm for a variety of activities, but they are much less cumbersome than wearing a pair of snow pants. I got the size 28 pants for my eldest daughter and they are a great fit. As you can see from the included images, the length of the leg from hip to cuff is about 38 inches. The knees have extra padding, and the exterior material is both wind and water resistant. The pants also include a lightweight belt. These are great pants for any outdoor adventure.",0.9765,114,16.285714285714285,0.0,2.29295
"I have 10, 20 and 30 pound dumbbells and they take up a lot of room and look unattractive when you just stack them in a corner. This rack is an ideal solution for a small set of weights. I assembled it while watching football and it went together easily. The rack comes with a hex wrench, but you will need a wrench to hold the bolts in place for tightening.<br /><br />The rack has rubber sleeves that fit over the hooks so there is no concern you might scratch your dumbbells. The rack is very stable, however, I wouldn't recommend allowing a toddler or a small child to play near the rack when it is loaded.<br /><br />There are five slots with wider separation at the bottom. There is enough space where I can put my 30 pound weight at the bottom, and the 20 pound weight on the next slot. The manufacturer recommends a maximum weight of 200 pounds. This is a great rack for getting your personal weights organized.",0.9316,200,25.0,0.1,1.90948
"It's amazing how much of a makeover a new handlebar wrap can give to an old bike. This Fizik tape has just the right amount of padding to provide for a comfortable riding experience. The tape has a line of double sided tape running down the middle. All you have to do is peel off the blue backing and start to wrap. If you've never wrapped your handlebars before, just watch a quick YouTube video. It's an easy process, and if it doesn't turn out as you want the first time, you can unwrap and begin again.<br /><br />You always begin at the bottom of your bars and wrap going inward toward the stem. If you start at the stem and go out, your hands will rub against the overlap of the tape and cause it to wear out quickly. This set includes a small piece of handlebar tape for behind your brake levers, and a piece of black tape to secure the wrap at the stem. The kit also includes bar end plugs. Make sure you install these because an open handlebar tube can gouge your leg if you get into a crash.<br /><br />This tape looks great and is comfortable and durable. It's a great choice to give your bike a new look.",0.979,250,22.727272727272727,0.1,2.3236999999999997
"My girls are 7 and 9 and they love these goggles for sledding. It's good to have some eye protection because they can't steer their sled very well and sometimes they end up in the bushes. It's pretty easy to get poked in the eye from a stick or a branch, and these are durable enough to deflect small hazards. They're also good for snowball fights.<br /><br />The goggles are lightweight and flexible with good cushioning around the rim so your kids won't complain of discomfort. The strap is easy to adjust for a secure and comfortable fit. We had some issues with fogging, but I had good results with a spray lens treatment I use on my other skiing gear. You get two goggles and a carrying bag. Your kids will enjoy the protection these goggles give against bright snow, windburn, and the other common dangers of playing outside in the winter.",0.9805,177,22.125,0.0,2.29415
"This is a very warm winter jacket that will keep you comfortable in very harsh conditions. I'm an avid cross-country skier, and after a workout it's important to slip into a high quality jacket. This jacket feels like putting on a sleeping bag and it will have you toasty warm in no time. The label says it has a polyester lining, and I haven't seen any signs of down feathers poking out between the seams.<br /><br />The jacket has a shiny appearance and the shell feels almost slick to the touch. It is good at repelling water, so it won't get wet if you're out in the snow. I liked the lining fabric on the front pockets. There's nothing fuzzy that might get caught on a ring or keys, but your hands feel well insulated. There is also an inside pocket that is ideal for a cell phone or wallet. The hood is large enough to be useful, and covers your head even if you're wearing a hat. An elastic cinch cord extends from either end with a plastic cord lock on both sides.<br /><br />The zipper is really nice and never gets caught up on the inner lining. It is important to have a quality zipper on a quality jacket because nothing is worse than when your zipper jams up. This zipper has big teeth and smooth action. I also like the cuffs and waist material which are form fitting but not too tight. This is a very nice jacket for skiing, or just staying warm for city winter life.",0.9886,302,21.571428571428573,0.0,2.29658
"My kids got very excited when they opened up this box and saw all the different sports they could play with this versatile kit. In an era where our children all seem to be slaves to cell phones, this is a great way to get your kids up and active. If you've got a decent sized back yard, or even a large basement that gives little ones enough room to move around, you'll get them running and laughing with this kit.<br /><br />It takes a little bit of time to put the net together and I wish the instructions had been printed in a bigger font because they were hard to see. However, the construction is pretty intuitive and it goes together easily. Some components of the net are held together with Velcro so you can fold it down and put it in the trunk of your car for a trip to the park.<br /><br />The set comes with a little air pump and a needle that gets the job done along with a small, rubber soccer ball. It also has one small ball that feels like it's made out of tough foam, and three squishy balls that are perfect for juggling or sticking to the back of the net. It also includes a birdie. Two knee hockey sticks and two badminton rackets complete the set.<br /><br />This is a good starter sports kit that is tough enough for rough play, but is kid friendly and safe. My kids are 9 and 7 and they're having a great time with it.",0.9842,302,33.55555555555556,0.1,2.3252599999999997
Pickleball is a great game to enjoy with family and friends. This paddle is a good choice for anyone who is just learning the game of pickleball. The handle is a little shorter than some other paddles so it's a good choice for women or people with smaller hands. The paddle curves up from the handle in a teardrop shape that prevents you from bumping your wrist with the handle. The swing weight is good and this is a great paddle that will provide you with years of fun playing pickleball with your friends. This paddle is USAPA approved.,0.987,106,17.666666666666668,0.0,2.2961
"This pickleball paddle looks exactly like the manufacturer's image. The aluminum body allows for great swing weight and the grip is soft and comfortable. These paddles are USAPA approved and the handle is long enough to accommodate people with large hands. Pickleball is a great sport that is challenging enough to keep you entertained, but easy enough that you don't need to be a world-class athlete to enjoy it. It's a great game for getting light exercise on a pleasant summer day, and this is a great paddle for both beginners and experts.",0.989,103,20.6,0.0,2.2967
"I often take my kids to the pool and there's nothing they love more than paddling around with their swimming goggles. I grabbed this two pack to have on hand since it seems like their goggles are always getting lost, and it quickly became their favorite set of goggles. They are easy to adjust and don't fog up. I like that they came with a convenient carrying bag so you can gather up all your equipment after swimming and keep track of it in your gear bag. I also like the ear plugs which prevent the annoying sensation of getting water in your ear. The ear plugs are comfortable and work much better than a swimming cap. These are a great set of goggles for anyone who enjoys spending time in the pool.",0.968,143,20.428571428571427,0.0,2.2904
"If you have never played Pickleball, you're in for a treat. Pickleball is a great backyard game that is slow paced enough that everyone can participate. It's fun for everyone from children to grandparents, and it's an ideal game to get people off their cell phones and out enjoying some light exercise. Normally you play with a net, but we like to use our set on the beach where we just try to volley the ball back and forth to each other. This set comes with two fantastic paddles and four balls. The balls are heavy enough to acquire velocity, but light enough that they get caught in the air for fun play. You'll have a blast playing Pickleball with this wonderful set!",0.9876,138,19.714285714285715,0.0,2.29628
"These are really nice goggles that are perfect for a variety of sports. It's fall here in Wisconsin and I've been using mine for bike rides because there are a lot of insects down by the river on my favorite bike trail this time of year. The goggles block out the sun, but aren't so dark that they make visibility difficult in low light. The lens doesn't fog up and there is a comfortable foam boarder that helps keep sweat out of your eyes. I also like the comfortable adjustable band. These are a great set of googles for all kinds of outdoor activities.",0.9672,115,19.166666666666668,0.0,2.29016
"This is a very nice racket. It's a carbon fiber construction with a comfortable grip and a super light swing weight. You basically can't even tell you're holding this racket it is so light. The racket is fantastic for everything from backyard games that get very competitive, to serious competition.<br /><br />The case is attractive, durable and very well-made. This set also comes with 6 Shuttlecocks. This is a great selection for anyone who is serious about their Badminton.",0.9683,97,16.166666666666668,0.1,2.32049
"This Camelbak 20L backpack is lightweight and easy to use. It's a convenient size, somewhere between a standard backpack and a handbag that's great for trips to the gym or short hikes with your kids. The top rolls shut which is much more convenient that a zipper or a cinch clothing mechanism. There is a stiff material inserted on either side of the opening which maintain the bag's form as you push them together and roll it closed. The clasp has a magnetic element which helps assist you in connecting the male and female components.<br /><br />Inside the bag there is a hanging pouch with a zipper that is perfect for wallets, keys, or a cell phone. Behind the hanging pouch there is a pouch for a hydration bladder. There is also access for a hydration tube to be strung through the shoulder straps. There is an external pouch on the front of the bag and two side pouches, one of which zips closed.<br /><br />The straps are fully adjustable and even feature an adjustable chest clasp. This is a great, quick-drying backpack that you'll quickly become addicted to.",0.9595,221,24.55555555555556,0.0,2.28785
"I got this mainly for my wife, but I also do the p90x Yoga routine and know the value of a good mat. I liked this mat design better than the typical rolls you see people carrying around. Those rolls tend to curl up at the ends which gets pretty annoying and is a distraction from what you're trying to achieve. This mat lays absolutely flat and is easy to clean (hand wash, don't put it in the washing machine).<br /><br />The surface has a good grip and you feel very stable whether you use it with bare feet or socks. It's not as thick as a typical mat, but it is very large and you can fold it up on itself if you need extra padding. The product measures 70 inches by 24 inches and comes in an attractive box that makes this an ideal gift.<br /><br />The fabric is thick enough not to tear and provides a little bit of cushion although this really can't be called a pad. Still, I liked the portability and non-slip features of this mat. Also, it's small enough to fit in a backpack, so you don't have to carry around a huge rolled up tube. Finally, it doesn't pick up odors even with regular use.<br /><br />The product description says ""towel"" mat, but this is not really a towel. One side of the mat has a kind of rubbery, grip surface, and the other side feels like a dense knit cloth, but you wouldn't want to try to dry yourself off with this. It's thick enough that it would prevent sticks from poking through the mat.<br /><br />For anyone who doesn't like normal Yoga mats, this is an innovative and effective design that is sanitary and built to last.",0.9959,363,33.0,0.0,2.29877
"I tend to call this game ""bean bags"" but I guess ""Cornhole"" is the official name. It's a great game for a lazy afternoon with family or friends, or to set up when you're grilling. You set the tables up opposing each other and then take turns trying to throw your bean bags into the hole at the top/center of the table. Each player gets four shots. We usually score it three points if you get one in the hole and one if you get a bag on the table, but I haven't read the instructions to see what the ""official"" rules are. I'm sure every state has a regional variation of this game, and this set is good enough to play with whatever rules you want.<br /><br />First of all, the tables are quite large. They measure about 2 feet by 4 feet wide. The tables have legs at the end with the hole that fold out so that they can be set up at an angle. I liked the material of these tables. I've played on sets that had a lot of give that allowed you to aim for the base of the table so your bean bag will slide right up into the hole. These sets feel sort of ""dead"" and your bean bag doesn't travel much. This requires a more skillful toss and it makes it harder to hit the hole.  I like that because the result is fewer ties.<br /><br />The carrying case is a large black bag with a zipper top. The tables fit into the bag, but it's kind of a tight fit. I tend to put the tables into the bag and then put the bean bags through the hole so that they sit between the tables. I have a Subaru Forester and the carrying case fits in that easily enough, but if you have a smaller car you might struggle bringing this set along to the beach. Also, it's a little awkward to carry, although it's not overly heavy.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great cornhole set, this one is as good as anything out there. It sets up quick, packs away fast, and the carrying case helps protect the set while in storage. I like that it's labeled as a ""professional"" set, and it forces you to use good, precise tosses in order to win. Great fun at a grill, family gathering, or at the beach. Also, tossing bean bags is nice because if there are kids around they aren't going to get banged in the head by an errant horseshoe or something.<br /><br />If you're looking for a family activity to help get your kids off their cell phones for a few minutes, look no further.",0.9973,547,26.047619047619047,0.0,2.29919
"Although this is designated as a Boys' jacket, I got it for my daughter. I think they could have easily marketed it as a unisex jacket since it is a very basic, simple, and pragmatic design. We live in Northern Wisconsin so we know a good jacket when we see one. Colombia is always a trusted brand and this jacket does not disappoint.<br /><br />The only trick in picking a jacket online is getting the sizing right. My daughter is 9 and although I was confident this would fit, I also knew that I have a 6 year old waiting in the wings. I'm fairly sure that when my older daughter grows out of this the younger one will take it on (although sometimes hand-me-downs are inexplicably rejected). I got lucky with the sizing, it fit my 9 year old perfectly. I included some photos with a tape measure so that you can see how long the zipper and the arms are. I suggest measuring an article of clothing that you have in your home to compare.<br /><br />The zipper was 22 inches from the collar to the waist, and the arm was about 16 inches from the armpit to the wrist (note that the tape measure extends beyond the armpit in the photo). Also note that I measured the bottom of the sleeve not the top.<br /><br />I'm pleased with this jacket but I took off a star for two reasons. 1. I would have liked this jacket to have some reflective elements. I'm a little hesitant to let my girl run around in a black jacket because of visibility concerns. However, she is with me most of the time so I don't believe it will be a problem. 2. I would have preferred pockets that close with a zipper. This keeps snow out of them when you go out sledding, and it also makes sure that you don't lose whatever ""precious"" treasures your kids happen to pick up. These are very minor criticisms, this is a very good jacket.",0.9555,401,22.27777777777778,1.3,2.27665

"This is a great light. I use lights like these for cycling, camping, running and cross-country skiing, and this is one of the best lamps I've ever used. The straps are easy to adjust and big enough to fit over a cycling helmet (which is a huge plus). The three lights allow for a super bright beam. There's even a strobe feature, although I don't know what that would be for exactly (maybe for signaling help).<br /><br />The batteries come packaged within the case, but note that you have to remove the plastic wrapping on the batteries before using the item (you can't just pull this out of the package and turn it on). A charger is included and hooks up with ease.<br /><br />Very good bright light. Use it for household projects or scaling Mt.

"This bag works great. The seal at the top clamps down tightly so that no water can get into your camera. This is about the best way I can think of to obtain a functional, underwater camera. I haven't tried this out at extreme depths, but it does work for just splashing around the pool. When you get your bag, I'd recommend you try it out by stuffing a piece of tissue in the bag and submerging it. Leave it under water for a while so you can see the tissue is still dry after use. This will allay your concerns before you try it with your $1000 phone.<br /><br />I also do a lot of cycling and adventure sports that take place outdoors. This is a great bag for bringing the phone along so it's not destroyed by sweat or rain (I've had both ruin phones).

The weight will take longer to say for sure, but I don't see how this could not help.<br /><br />I really like how it has so many options for skill level, so as I get better with it, I can start upping the difficulty, keeping it challenging.

The blade is completely flat where the sharp edge would be, I think it'd have looked better to have polished the edge so it's not sharp but looks more realistic. But again, for the price- it's decent. I think it's a safer toy for kids since it doesn't have a sharp edge but the end is still pointy enough that a kid could stab someone while playing with it so maybe still not a great choice for smaller kids.",-0.6729,106,26.5,0.0,0.9981300000000002

The little handheld squeeze ones could never do this good of a job at cleaning either! I'll be bringing this on every trip I go on now! They're also working on our waterlines so I have a couple buckets of water and use this thing with the included spray end and it makes for a nice faucet to wash your hands and such when you can't have running water.

Had a big water pipe bust underground at our house so we are filling and hanging these over the bathroom sink to be able to wash our hands and they work perfectly for that! You just push the spout into the bottom of the bag firmly and it stays/ doesn't leak at all. Then fill the top and put the lid back on and you're in business.

The bags are a thick plastic though so you definitely need to keep them away from sharp things.,0.9606,140,28.0,0.0,2.28818
"The paint job is cool, and has stayed on, despite a good deal of use. It came really sharp, and I use it as a general purpose knife, it cuts open packages mostly. But has been used on lots of other things in and around the home and outdoors. It's stayed sharp enough, which is good, as I don't look forward to sharpening such a strange shape. It's been good quality, especially for the price point. The sheath works, but isn't the best I've had.",0.0759,104,17.333333333333332,0.0,2.02277

This is definitely on the lighter end but for the price it's not bad at all. It definitely does the job and is easy enough to assemble. I'm using mine to run water in a tank on it and heat a hot tub. It works great for this! Highly recommend this little wood stove!,0.9749,61,12.2,0.0,2.29247
"I ordered 3X because of a horrible knee injury limiting physical activity, I've gained a little weight. 3X in other shirts fit me very well and are very roomy. THIS one has the 3X length for sure which is awesome because I can sit down without my shirt riding up when I'm sitting in a chair. But as far as how it fits around my body, it fits more like a shirt that was for slightly smaller people. I've seen companies do this, they make larger sizes for taller people, not larger people. I'm about 260 and 5 foot 10"" and this fits me comfortably but not as comfortably as other companies shirts do. The proportions seem a little off. It's not a deal-breaker though, I'll still wear it. Just an observation.<br /><br />Quality-wise- it's soft, the printing looks decent. No complaints there. Fabric is pretty thin, you can hold it up and see your hand underneath it. I love shirts like this in warmer months though so no complaints from me.",0.989,206,17.166666666666668,0.2,1.9567

"They are a pretty decent pair of sunglasses. They're lightweight which is nice. They fit my big head pretty decently. They snug up against my face which will be great for riding my bike or electric scooter on windy days- normally my eyes water like crazy but these absolutely keep that from happening!<br /><br />The lens itself is SUPER thin so I don't know what kind of protection they'd be in a work environment, my guess is not much. It'd be better than nothing of course. As far as polarization- they definitely are (you can test this by sticking two pairs of polarized lenses in front of each other and looking thru them.) They have great clarity and I can see very well thru them.<br /><br />Overall I think they're pretty impressive. As an overall average consumer- would I spend over $100 on a pair of sunglasses? Nope.

This is a ton of fun to play with! I prefer it over a traditional board because I've seen walls around real dartboards- they're covered in holes.

"I was surprised to find out the mayo clinic actually states you can lose some calories with these, I always thought they were a sham! So I got one to test and it vibrates extremely well! Very fancy well made piece of machinery! If any of them can give you weight loss- then this one surely will work for that! Quality seems great all around.<br /><br />As for my opinion on whether it does what it should? I still remain unsure. I'll keep using it and see if it helps long term but it seems like it'd be hard to tell for sure whether or not it helps. Mayo clinic recommends exercising in conjunction with this machine so is that also their way of admitting not to put all of your eggs into one basket and this isn't a miracle cure? You can decide that for yourself. As for this product- it definitely vibrates and is well made so there's that!<br /><br />I figure if anything I can possible dual purpose it and put a plate across it- use it for a vibration plate for resin and concrete casting to vibrate the bubbles out!",0.9174,224,22.4,0.1,2.30522
"We added this light onto our electric scooter as our built in light on the scooter is short sighted and we can only see right in front of us.

Helps me see people on the walking paths at night!<br /><br />For the small size, I'm truly blown away at how bright this is! Very happy with it. Very easy to install.

"At higher speeds the batteries just rattle like crazy- it's EXTREMELY annoying. Trying to figure out how to make it stop rattling. Other than that- this things amazing! I added it to my electric scooter as the light built into it is very short sighted and only lights up the area right in front of us. While riding scooters on the trails at night in the dark, we can't see ahead enough to tell if people are there or not. SO I put this on the handlebar and pointed it up a bit- it lights up reflective signs WAY far away so the light travels pretty far! The best thing is it lights up quite a bit in front of us so now I can see when people are coming on the trail and I can move over to give them space.<br /><br />Love this flashlight!",0.9091,163,23.285714285714285,0.0,2.27273
"I honestly didn't realize just how big this thing was gonna be but it's fine, we have big phones so it's great! We put our phones in this, wet wipes, and eye drops (always getting bugs or something in our eyes.)<br />This pouch is really good quality, semi rigid so it keeps it's shape. Many of you will have a fun time installing this because of the brake lines on your scooter but with a little patience it IS doable just fine. This picture is my pouch installed on an adult scooter so that gives you an idea of just how big it is!<br />The zipper is slightly difficult to mess with thanks to the brake lines but like the velcro you use to attach it with, it's doable still. The velcro attaches very well to the scooter and secures the bag perfectly! Doesn't flop around or anything while riding which is nice!<br /><br />Overall I'm just thrilled with this pouch and LOVE the green. The safety reflectiveness of it is a nice touch!<br />**It should be noted that it photographed a little more vivid green than it is, it's really a lighter neon green color.

"I have a 50 watt megaphone from Pyle that I am a LOT more happy with. Plus it has a lot of extra features like bluetooth and a handheld mic where this blue megaphone doesn't have any of that! What's crazy is the other megaphone I have actually comes in at a lower price and has more features and power even, I don't understand it!<br /><br />SO on this megaphone, the flashlight is an odd thing but it works ok. Don't know why it needed it but it does work ok. The megaphone itself, the first one I got came not working. The next one works but it has a lot of feedback in it and doesn't get that loud at all! I REALLY hate this megaphone and highly recommend you skip it and try something like the Pyle brand. The only downside I can say about the Pyle one is it takes a bunch of batteries and doesn't come with a rechargeable battery pack. I think they make one for it though!<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NCPG5V8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1",-0.615,209,26.125,0.0,1.0155000000000003

"I honestly expected cheap quality from a company I'd never heard of but figured I'd give it a try and can absolutely say this chair is my new favorite!! It has a nice carrying bag with a drawstring and when you pull the chair out, it's velcroed together on the back so it doesn't just flop open. I unstrapped the velcro in the back and unfolded it. Instantly I noticed a nice heavier fabric and a very good looking chair! I have a friend who is 250 ish and he sat in the chair without any problems at all. It didn't bow or break or feel flimsy under his weight. It says the limit I know but often they'll hold no where near that... This one definitely can hold the weight it says. I can't find a flaw to complain about on the chair. With even a non skinny person sitting in the chair, there's plenty of room and the chair is pretty comfortable! The quality is impressive for an off brand.<br /><br />Note to the manufacturer:<br />Please stop covering your products with your company name, I speak for everyone when I say- none of us want this. You're not some huge known company like Adidas, Mossy Oak, whatever... So just skip the printing of your logo on the gear, we're just fine without it and it surely saves you money by not having to add it.",0.9936,279,21.46153846153846,0.0,2.29808

This is a great basic elliptical that works really well and is pretty well made. I've very impressed and happy with it- it's a great addition to my gym!! Used it many many hours now and have no real complaints. I'm not a small person at all, I'm taller and wider and this machine works great for me!",0.9929,137,19.571428571428573,0.0,2.29787
"Well made heavy duty board, gets very rigid when you air it up and is very easy to stand up and paddle on! Works great for beginners too!

Works great for those who have a hard time getting back onto it.",0.9594,121,30.25,0.2,2.34782

We had concerns about a air up sup board but these actually do air up nicely and become rigid enough to use just fine!<br /><br />Definitely grab one of these and give it a try, you'll love it!",0.973,154,38.5,0.0,2.2919
"I got this not realizing you have to PAY to be able to use your streaming services that you already pay for! Makes no sense to me! It's extortion to lock your streaming apps in this to where you can only use them if you pay a bunch of money each year on top of the price you already pay for those streaming services. I'm very disappointed in this as I won't be subscribing to their overpriced service. Just have to put my tablet on the tablet slot and use that instead so I can watch Netflix or Hulu while working out.<br /><br />That aside, this is indeed heavy yes but any good treadmill is going to be. If you want a light one, go with one of the models with no motor, you can get ones that even slide under the bed or desk! But if you want a motorized treadmill, a good one is gonna be heavy! SO did I need help putting this together/ moving this? No. I'm not a weight lifter at all but I managed to barely drag this part by part into my garage from the driveway where the delivery service left it. I then managed to assemble it myself with no problem. It's a lot of little parts to put together but no harder than putting anything else together.<br /><br />One of the big thing I love about this is the space saving folding feature! It's easy to lift it up and lock it into the upright position. Then it has their ""soft drop"" feature where it uses strut arms (like the lift arms on a rear door of a vehicle that goes up) and this makes it to where it slowly drops the treadmill gently by itself without ever slamming it down. That thing also is why it's so easy to lift it up so easily.<br /><br />Running on this: the 15% incline is really nice and the motor works smoothly. The 20 x 60 running area is VERY nice to have, my last one was much smaller and it was harder to enjoy my workout on. This thing absorbs the shock of your steps really well which will be better on your joints than running on concrete or ground in general.<br /><br />Bottom line is: I've used this many times and am very impressed by it! For the price point, it's completely worth it. If you wanted to go cheaper however, you might look at something like the NordicTrack T 6.5s Treadmill which comes in at less than a 1/3 of the price! It has a slightly smaller running surface and only a 10% incline but if you're on a budget then I'd go with that one. Otherwise this Bowflex is great if you are fine with what they've done with the monitor on them. I would strongly urge Bowflex to unlock the monitors in the future and allow users to stream tv without having to have a subscription. You'll have a lot less complaints this way and it just doesn't make sense to charge people to be able to use a service they already paid for.<br /><br />The warranty on this is fantastic if they stand by it! It makes the price point seem a little better if they're willing to offer 15 years frame & motor, 5 years parts, and 2 years labor warranties.",0.9976,657,27.375,2.0,2.49928

"Overall this is a good bike. The assembly was pretty easy compared to putting furniture together. It arrived without any damage, which is good. The seat is pretty big but it's hard and not soft, so the increase in comfort is only it's size being bigger. The peddling is smooth and it's pretty quiet, you only hear the whirring of the fan. My wife is 4'11"" and I am 6'5"" and we both can use it just fine. The seat adjusts enough for us both to use it. It is solid and does not move around when using it. The only thing I'd change is the placement of the fan, so that it blows air on you instead of blowing out in front of the bike. You have to reverse peddle to get the air on you. Otherwise, good bike.",0.9849,164,14.909090909090908,0.1,1.92547

"Word of caution on the size of this ball, it is much smaller than anticipated. I am 6'5&#34; @270lbs and ordered the 75cm based on other reviews and the size chart I found online. I purchased this ball to sit on to work core and back strength but I am going to say this 75cm is only good for people up to 6'0&#34; in height. I was expecting a size comparable to something I've used and seen at local gyms and it's not.Will be using this to sit at a desk and replace the office chair, so it may or may not work for someone my size based on how you plan to use it. I am going to be sitting a little low unfortunately.<br /><br />The quality of the item I felt was on par with the price. Not heavy duty like the balls you use or see at a gym but adequate for home use. If you have kids around who may be tempted to use it for other things, it may not last as long as you'd like it to.<br /><br />The hand pump is probably the weakest part of the product. Although it does the job well and using it is almost exercise itself, the tube doesn't appear that it will last very long because it's so thin, especially at the end that attaches to the pump itself. It's thin enough that I thought it may split or crack when I put it on the pump.<br /><br />All in all, ok for the price.

It seems weird to have it listed as two when it is only one.<br /><br />It was a little tricky to pump up as it felt like the needle would go through the disk. Once it was sorted, it took a little to get it the right fullness. We use these as fidget/bumpy seats for kids.<br /><br />These are easy to clean.

One person did it in less than 15 minutes and it comes with an Alan wrench.<br /><br />This is not as stable as I would like.

"This unique shade umbrella covers your chair or section of table efficiently. No extra overhang to provide fodder for the wind. It is big, and not light, but that's good because you want it to stay in place. The clamp adjusts to a wide variety of supports. I clamped it to the metal tubes holding up the back of my folding chair. It would also work on a table. The silvery top reflects hot sun and dangerous UV. The inside is black for extra density. It comes in a huge long box, but don't be intimidated. It fits in your back seat or trunk with ease. It has a self-fabric light but strong carrying case you can sling over your shoulder.

"Designed for cyclists, these glasses are lightweight and fit snuggly on your nose in several different positions. If you are riding uphill and perspiring, you can push them farther down on your nose and they will stay put. They also stay in place if you push them up toward your forehead. The standard, straight-ahead position for sunglasses isn't the most comfortable, at least for me. (but I might be doing something wrong.)<br /><br />The frames are not really flexible, but the ends are, allowing for a bit of a custom fit. The lenses seem to be replaceable (but I'm not sure about this.) The lenses themselves are sharp, clear, and glare-reducing. There are vents in the arms to promote ventilation and prevent fogging.<br /><br />I wish the instructions had been clearer.  Also, for hiking and driving, they might not be the best. Because they sit high my nose and away from my face, they leave the bottom of my field of vision unfiltered. Some people might like this, and it is probably great for cyclists, so take this with a grain of salt.<br /><br />+ These glasses have a lot of specialized features for cyclists. +The nose piece is very snug, which would be good for many, but uncomfortable for me.",0.9499,266,20.46153846153846,0.1,1.91497

I'm also not adept at using it. I can sync the Vivofit to my trusty desktop and access trackers and community online.

I could have used two or even three. They are small but mighty.<br /><br />They are not designed for therapeutic use, so if your knee or ankle hurts, bring along something created for that purpose.

The crown is lightweight, flexible, and vented. It also has a cord to adjust the size of the hatband! At first, I thought it was a bit big, but that was easy to fix. Hatmakers have finally realized that wind exists and are including chin cords.

There's also a flap in front that's vented for coolness and easy breathing. Admittedly, you'll look a little odd with both of these flaps snapped in place, but if you've been out hiking or fishing in the summer, you know others may be asking where you got it after they finish laughing.  In any case, the hat is very versatile. You can use one of the flaps or neither of them. They snap on and off. Lightweight synthetic fabric, they tuck into your pocket when not in use.

Actually, I only use the pink one--the least powerful, They come with a paper suggesting three simple but powerful exercises that build muscle strength using only your own body (and the band best suited to your current condition). Sometimes less is more. You can remember them easily and do them anywhere. They do warn that not all exercises are for everyone. I have vulnerable knees, and I'm not going to do the lunge again. You know what works for you and what doesn't. I love these because they are great for small spaces. I exercise in my home office in the small space in front of the TV. I walk on a rebounder there. It's really a little too small for Zumba, but the exercises recommended for these bands work well. I also like the fact it would be easy to toss one into a carry-on for trips.

"New Years resolutions anyone? This boxed set has everything you need to get started on a fitness program. The first thing you notice when you open the kit is the weights. They are shakers. How fun is that? Two booklets are included.One, the program guide, offers a schedule for using the workouts. I don't know about you, but doing the same thing every day bores me. That's not a problem with this set. The program guide suggests using different workout routines every day of the week, with a day of rest after each two days of workouts. The exercise choreography itself is not only sound for building fitness, it's also witty, imaginative, and lots of fun. I'm out of shape, so I have to modify the movements a lot, but the instructors are excellent and work into each movement slowly, pointing out correct form to avoid injury. My room is very small, and some of the dance moves do take a little more space than I have. It's not just standing in one spot, but I am still able to do them. The chair routines are fantastic. They are designed for your upper body and abs, but you really get a full body workout.<br /><br />Also included is a booklet with a great nutrition guide. It has a full week's worth of meals with recipes, and it's small enough to stick in your purse or pocket when you go to the store. The meals feature the latest weight-loss and cardiac health superstars, but everything you need will be at your neighborhood supermarket.<br /><br />The heart of the program is a set of four DVDs with the instructions and specialized workouts. There is also a bonus &#34;Fitness Concert&#34; for those of you who are more advanced. It's great to go to a live class, but in the winter that can be hard. There are also advantages to dancing around your own room. (no embarrassment when you trip over your own feet)<br /><br />I love this!

"As you can see from the picture the shower tent is enormous! Our son is 6'5"" and he was perfectly content inside.  It was so nice to use our outside shower on our fifth wheel and be comfortable. No arms touching the sides. The only thing it's missing is the option to fully unzip all the windows That way I could have chosen what side my door went on and possibly hooks to actually hold something like a shower head. I'm not sure the two small hooks in the middle top of the shower tent would hold anything like a bag of water.

"SO ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!<br />I have been doing yoga for about 3 years, and I bought this for my boyfriend as a way of getting him to do yoga with me. This is not the kit for him or anyone else.<br /><br />This is NOT even a kit for beginners --- Beginners: Stay away from this mat and get a mat that does NOT come from a kit (Gaiam is fine; just not this one).<br /><br />The Mat: This mat is so ridiculously thin. Some are the super expensive mats are thin too, but they are made of really high-quality material and can give surprising cushioning. This is NOT one of them. This mat was so thin and looked like it could rip very easily. It won't last you long--you would want to get a new mat very quickly (assuming that this mat doesn't put beginners off yoga altogether, if it makes them think yoga is too painful on the floor), so it isn't worth any &#34;savings&#34;.<br /><br />The blocks: These blocks are not yoga blocks. They are way too thin, and you would probably wobble if trying to use them for support.<br /><br />The strap: It's a strap. You could easily substitute with the tie from a bathrobe. Whatever.<br /><br />The CD: Do you know how many yoga videos there are free on youtube? And other video streaming services? I never looked at this.<br /><br />I returned this product immediately, and instead bought the Gaiam Plum/Jam 5mm Yoga Mat for him. What a WORLD of difference!<br /><br />(For people who are more serious about yoga and want to have a mat that is excellent and lasts a long time, if not a lifetime, go for a Manduka mat or the Lululemon mat. The Manduka is slippy for the first couple of weeks as you break it in, which is very frustrating, but this mat will last you a lifetime...they even have lifetime guarantee. The lululemon mat I don't actually own, but I've tried it from my yoga instructor and it is one of the thin, but high quality ones--it's incredibly grippy right off the bat and has a great feel to it).",0.967,479,34.214285714285715,0.8,0.9300999999999999

"My husband was off work from December 28th until January 19th with horrible back pain caused by a slipped disk. After two trips to the chiropractor which helped some she highly recommended an inversion table. I was ready to try anything to get this active man back to work. He hauls hay, cows, mechanics and welds, owns two businesses so a house mouse if very far from his normal lifestyle. I was in charge of finding one and here in Wyoming that usually means facebbok classifieds, traveling or ordering. I found one on amazon right away and was thrilled that one was under a $100, shipped via prime. I honestly thought a piece of equipment like this would be 2-3 times that! It did take a little longer then most prime items to arrive. It was easy to assemble, quality product too. The most important part is the relief it has brought him!

This punchy ball set will grant you 4 balls with elastic string attached, one headband, and hopefully a sense of humor.<br /><br />On a more serious note, this is a very effective way to challenge your own dexterity, get your blood pumping, and challenge yourself in a scaleable fashion via the length of the elastic string. The colors included were green, black, red, and orange. They all have the same density which is that of a slightly weighted foam ball.",0.9505,159,39.75,0.0,2.28515
"At a glance, this bike lock looks amazing. It is composed of many small plates contained in a rust-proof plastic shell. I believe these are highly resistant to bolt cutters but it seems like the weak point would be the individual joints if stomped when flat with no support. This bike lock will DEFINITELY stop petty theft. The mounting design is nice and simple, I don't see any way for it to break in the next year or so without extreme user misuse, so I am happy for that.<br /><br />This bike cannot compare to a U-Bike lock, but it is absolutely superior to a chain or steel rope lock.",0.9423,128,25.6,0.0,2.28269

"I have two family members who do guard work and have shifts at night. With things getting super cold I knew these hand warms would be awesome for them. They aren't outside all the time but when they are, I know their hands get cold and these are amazing to keep in their pockets and even slide into their gloves when they are outside. These get very warm and keep their hands nice and toasty, and can be made cooler or warmer with just a press of a button. They last a good while on a single charge and charge fairly fast when charging. These also work great for the hunter in your life as well. My husband tried these out when he went hunting and has already told me he wants some for himself. So they are five stars here in this house, lol.",0.989,157,19.625,0.0,2.2967
Husband is very happy with these lures. He goes hunting or fishing every chance he can get. He has been talking about needing more lures so I knew these would be perfect and I was right.

It is so easy to use and with me having major knee problems there are so many exercises that I can do with this bar that I just can't do with other equipment. The feet grips stay in place and make it easy to do pullups and all kinds of other upper body and lower body exercises. The bar itself goes together nicely and is even easy to take apart to put away for another time. The only complaint that I have is I do with it came with a storage bag to store the bar in when I am finished. Other than that though, I love this exercise bar and I use it multiple times a day.

"Now that I have used this Fitbit for a few weeks I feel like I have an idea about it. I've wanted a Fitbit for years, I've heard nothing but amazing things about it and how great they are. Well, to be honest, I am not seeing the greatness of them now that I actually have one. Maybe it's because this is the newest one, maybe there are still bugs to fix, and maybe it could be my phone that just hates everything about the Fitbit app. Honestly, I don't know but either way, I am so unimpressed with this Fitbit.<br /><br />The pros I have found out is that it was easy to set up and make an account with Fitbit. Everything downloaded, updated, and whatever else perfectly. It was easy to change all the settings and personalize everything the way I wanted it. I love that you can customize the face so that it matches your personality or the types of apps or stuff you want it to show first right on the face. I like that you can control your music and pay for your watch too. Those are great ideas and honestly if I got out more and whatever else I can see where tons of people would totally get so much use out of it.<br /><br />My biggest beef I have with this though is the fact that I wear it constantly and I want to keep up mainly with my steps, how much I move, and my sleeping patterns. It doesn't have any problems keeping up with all of that and so much more. The problem I have with this watch is the fact that it disconnects from the wifi and then becomes difficult to sync to the app, if at all. I've already had to reset to factory settings once to get it to reconnect to the app, which also has its own set of challenges because once the watch goes the app doesn't want to do much either. I can't remove the watch to re-add it in the app and I'm unable to view the wifi connections to change them or re-add them. It's like everything stops and becomes completely unusable. It's a real pain, to say the least.<br /><br />Being completely honest, the watch I replaced with this Fitbit was way better and I never had any issues with it syncing to my phone, the app, or anything else. It did everything that this one does but just not as pretty, which honestly I'd much rather the watch to work and do what I want it to do than to have the cool face and whatever else.<br /><br />I am so unimpressed and honestly bummed about this watch not living up to the hype. I am hoping that everything works out and the bugs are fixed soon if these are bugs, but I've no idea. Right now the watch is acting up again and honestly, I am thinking I am about to have to reset it again. If this happens I am going back to my old one that I know works just fine. Honestly, don't waste your money on this one just yet but wait to see if the bugs are fixed in a few months.",0.9962,630,30.0,0.1,1.52886
I had some other resistance bands but I've had them forever and they finally gave out on me. Got these and totally love them. They work great and I love the workout I get from resistance bands. These are the perfect resistance for me too. They are easy to use and the handles hook to the bands without any problems. The best part about this is the bag that comes with these. It's an actual string bag and it's big enough to keep everything together but has room for the bands to relax and not be all cramped in on themselves.

"These gloves are working awesome for my gym workouts but also when I am wheeling around in my wheelchair. I don't know why I didn't get a pair of these gloves like these before, I should have started out with some of these gloves. Especially when I had to start using a wheelchair. People don't realize just how hard it is on your hands and so these have made it so much easier to wheel me around as they keep my hands from being slippery and gives me traction for when I need to stop or go faster.<br /><br />These are also great for when I'm at the gym. They help me keep a grip on the bars and also with covid going around, I feel better wearing these and then tossing them in the washer when I get home.

I've been using it all different kinds of ways and it is working my muscles really well. I have to say that I feel much better and safer, if you have ever used exercise bands and had one snap on you then you know what I am talking about, using this because it holds nicely on the feet and doesn't feel like it's slipping or bunching up at all like normal exercise bands. This is way cooler and a lot more fun to use than just normal exercise bands. I get a great workout using this and it has the perfect amount of resistance for me. Just a great addition to any workout.",0.9864,167,20.875,0.1,2.32592

Really good cooling towel. On these hot days during the summer this is great to have when I go out on my morning walks. Just wet this towel and the cooling effect starts to happen.

This is such a simple set of paddles that you wouldn't think it would be that great but it is pretty good. My boyfriend and I took it out to the back yard with his two kids and had a pretty great time with it. I do have to admit that the paddles themselves are a little heavy for smaller kids and holding the paddles start to become uncomfortable after a while because it is just a wooden paddle with some paint on them and a little something on the handle part. So it's not much. It's not the best set I have seen but it's not the worst either.

He plans on wearing this out for Halloween as well and going as his favorite Alabama player.<br /><br />It's a great set, I have to admit. It comes with a very nice helmet and chin strap so it can stay in place, and even a pair of sweat pants that are actually a pretty good quality.<br /><br />As for the jersey itself, it isn't the kind of jersey that you would get if you were a football player, it isn't that high of a quality but for it being what it is it isn't so bad. The jersey actually reminds me of the ones they use to practice in as it doesn't matter what happens to them.

I love that this is non toxic as I do have animals and knowing that this is okay to be around them makes me a lot better about using this product.

Yeah, I don't know the names of the exercises but I know how to do them, that is what counts. Anyway, I love how great these are and I'm not afraid they are going to break.

"These weights are pretty great. I can wrap them around my wrists and workout doing anything and they give me that extra boost to my workout that I want to help tone my arms. The only thing that I don't like about these wrist weights is the way the velcro goes around the weight and then attaches to itself so that it stays on. I have bigger wrists than a lot of people so instead of the teeth of the velcro coming around and actually attaching to the fuzzy part it attaches to the teeth part and it makes it harder for them to stay on properly. However, I simply safety pin them into place and it works out fine. If the fuzzy velcro came out a bit more these would be so much better though. Otherwise, they are a great addition to any workout.",0.9711,155,22.142857142857142,0.0,1.89133
This kinesio tape is awesome and saved my knee. I have bad knees anyway but when I started working out they would hurt so much.

This stuff didn't budge no matter how much I turned and worked out or how much I sweated. It works great and when I run out I will be getting more.

"I am very pleased with my order of the KSUOKAO Food Dehydrator. This is a great shape for placement on my countertop or easy storage in a cabinet. It's very easy to use, just push a few buttons on the top. The shelves are metal, and should not be exposed to prolonged moisture as the welded points are prone to light rust, as I have already experienced. I find this to be a great value. It has preformed very well as I have used it to make several batches of beef jerky and to dehydrate some apples.

The zippers are smooth, the stitching is solid and the fabric is light but resistant to rain. I find this will hold up under normal use in most environments. I really like how small it folds, as it takes very little space for storage between uses.

This did not take long to setup. A single person can do so, and it certainly goes faster with 2 or more. It did take longer than 3 minutes, but that is a factor that varies user to user and other considerations. The fabric is woven well and the stitching is solid. I appreciate the carrier, as it's easy to store between uses. I wouldn't recommend this for harsh weather, but we had a good experience using it during mild summer weather.

"Overall, I find the Crystal Clear Epoxy Resin Kit to perform as I would expect. The mold is a good shape, and well suited to use easily in regards to even pouring and de-molding. I personally prefer the 1:1 volume mix as it's simple math.<br /><br />The large problem I have with this kit is the lack of safety information and no way to access a Material Safety Data Sheet. The lack of consumer information on this product is troubling. It can be a health and safety concern for many users. For this reason, I cannot in good conscious recommend this kit, especially to new users. For those that have already decided to place an order, please do your due diligence to learn about the general health and safety measures that should be regarded when using epoxy products. If this information was provided, it would be a 5-star product. I hope that my experience with the product is helpful to you and you kindly will click the button below.<br /><br />Edit: After voicing my concerns about the lack of available safety information, the vendor did contact me. They sent an attachment for the Safety Data Sheet in a message via the messaging system in Amazon. They informed me that the new batches will be revised to include safety information.

"The Oceandrybag All Weather 20L 40L Durable Lightweight Floating Waterproof Dry Bag is a great order for me. Every time I get away from it all, I always end up on the water. Before, I was relying on very large plastic bags. I didn't like this very much because it left my belongings visible to everyone, and it also looked tacky. However, I was primarily concerned about keeping my towel, clothing, shoes and small personal belongings dry. Now, I can keep all of my belongings dry in a nice bag that was designed for these situations. This is a worthwhile order for me.

"I needed some new tent stakes and am very pleased to report that the LOYUDEQIU Tent Stakes Heavy Duty did a great job. My old stakes had plastic caps, and as you may imagine, they broke easily from my rubber mallet. These are all metal, didn't bend at all under pressure and went into the earth easily with very little effort. I like the hooks, which are a good angle for security.

"I really like these Heated Gloves because they are so simple to use. The batteries fit inside a pocket on each glove and hold a good charge. This is so handy while doing outdoor tasks like shoveling snow and even driving while my car is still cold inside.

"My little Chihuahua gets cold easily, so it's always great for me to dress her up to be cute. The BabYoung Girl Dog Clothes Knitted Dog Dress is ideal, as it's knit like a sweater to keep her warm, but it's also very cute. I picked the XS size in pink. The bows and lace trim is a really nice touch, the construction is solid. She enjoys the extra attention when we're out from looking extra cute in her little dog clothes. I like that it's soft and washes well. I would recommend this for any dog that needs to be warm and cute!",0.992,120,17.142857142857142,0.0,2.2976

I highly recommend these gloves to anyone that finds cold hands unpleasant. They are easy to re-charge and are supplied with the cable to do so. It does not take long to re-charge the batteries and they last for a long time, but it depends on how warm you need.

"Sumolux Fishing Hat Sun Hat can also be a visor, or just wear the neck cover with the hat or you can add the face shield... or not. There are several different ways to wear the hat. The top can be removed via a nylon zipper. The face shield and neck cover are removable with button snaps. The back of the cap has elastic and a hook and loop making it adjustable. My ponytail will fit out of the back, so it's very comfortable. I unfortunately experienced a sunburn on the top of my hair this summer, so for now on I will be wearing this cap to prevent that from happening ever again. I cannot put sunscreen lotion in my hair, very well. This is also great for doing many different activities because it's light-weight and will not make you feel warmer. Thanks for reading my review.

"The AGPTEK Bike Repair Tool Kits Bag is overall a nice thing to have, and gives me a few emergency tools when I'm away from home. The only small gripe I have is that it does slip down the bar sometimes, but other than that it's a good addition to my bike. I can also set my wallet and keys inside so I don't risk them slipping out of my pockets while I'm out exercising. The material that is used to make the bag has held up well during light rain, and it dried quickly once I had my bike back inside the garage. I would recommend this to bike riders for the multi-tool and bag alone. I'm a little unsure of the tire pry bars, as they are only plastic, but would probably work in a pinch.

"I like how the Crostice Clear Acrylic Paint Palette is great to use on either side so both right and left handed artists can hold it comfortably. I don't have very long arms, but I could hold this big palette comfortably. I put acrylics on the surface and used them for about a hour. I did not have a difficult time cleaning the palette when I was done because regular dish soap had it perfectly clean with minimal effort. One thing that's really great about an acrylic palette is you can tape either a light or dark piece of paper on the back and see the contrast of your paints against the contrast of your canvas or background colors. This is good for me. This way, I can determine what will mix well or contrast better so I'm not going back over previous layers to correct color experiments that didn't work for me. I find this to be much less frustrating than the way I used to use a white plastic palette.<br /><br />This is a nice palette set, I only use one at a time, but if I wanted to go between two paintings at once, I can keep separate palettes or invite a friend or family member to join me. Overall, I find this to be an excellent value and would highly recommend this purchase if you are considering a transparent palette.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.

I'd say it's comfortable for 4 to 5 assuming you're related, but if you're just friends then you may want to limit to 3.

"We like using glass whenever possible. I am always concerned about the chemicals from plastic leaking into the drinks. That is why I like this glass bottle so much. It provides the benefits of glass but the thick sleeve on the outside really goes a long way to protecting it. I have five kids and things get dropped in this house. Even if they are not using the glass, they might still knock over one of mine. The sleeve on this really protects it. We have had them fall and never had one break. Of course it's not impossible, but the chances are far less. In fact, we probably have a dozen Lifefactory products and haven't lost one.

My kids are young and the football doesn’t always go where they intend. It is nice that if they accidently get hit, it’s not really going to hurt them. Still it isn’t so soft that they can’t play with it. It being so soft and lightweight also makes it easy for them to lift, throw and play with. It is not too big – just the perfect size for them (they are ages 7, 8, and 10).<br /><br />I was happy with the quality.

"We got a lemon, it has a tear in the fabric and it is extremely hard to open and close.  That being said, there are other flaws in this design.  It's top heavy, so I can't hang bags on the back.  It folds to be almost the same size it was before so it can't fit in my van unless I remove the third row of seats.  And the storage compartment is very small.  All of these are drawbacks to the stroller functionality, not the bike attachment or jogging stroller if you plan on keeping it in a garage and using it around your neighborhood.",-0.4862,118,19.666666666666668,0.1,1.0841400000000003

I haven't had any problems with tearing or anything like this.<br /><br />The only one thing I would change is that it has a huge logo on it. I might prefer if that were a little smaller.<br /><br />Obviously, these are made at batting gloves, but you can use them for other purposes as well.

"This is really best used for what it is geared toward - training. It is smaller than a regular ball and a lot heavier. It's definitely good at honing your skills so that when you switch to a regular ball, it will seem all the easier. Part of the problem for us was that when we got it, it did not bounce quite like a regular ball. It was probably just a simple issue of it needed more air but if you don't have a pump with the correct interface handy, then you're going to have a problem. It wasn't great to use just as a regular ball - really a practice ball to help yourself is what it's made for. Overall, a great tool.

"This is an adorable little basketball, suitable for little kids. It goes with the other SKLZ products, but they can certainly play with it without it. What I like about it is that it is so realistic. My kids are a little small to play with a regular hard basketball, so this is a nice way they can get the feel of it without using something that is too heavy for them or too difficult to shoot. Plus there's a lot less damage if they accidentally hit something (or someone) with this as opposed to a real hard basketball. It's soft and does bounce. I was happy with the quality. My kids enjoyed it and I would recommend it.",0.945,134,16.75,0.2,2.3435
"I was very pleased with this batting tee. It was so superior to the others I've used for so many reasons. First, it is very convenient. It was easy to put together. it comes with a case and folds to make it easy to carry along, which is great since so many people will be bringing this bath and forth to games and batting practice. Next, it is built so well. My kids will hit the tee as much as (or more than) the balls so we need something sturdy. Well, this is it. It's very durable and you can see will last a long time.<br /><br />I loved the design. It's so nice that you can set up three balls at once. Now if they don't swing right you can knock them all down at once, so the kids will try to swing better so they have more swings and less picking up balls. it's great that you can adjust the heights of the balls so easily because you can run different drills. It makes it great for kids of different heights as well as to anticipate pitches of different levels. It is very easy to change this.<br /><br />This is a great batting tee, both for personal use or for a little league team. I'd definitely recommend it.",0.9955,263,17.533333333333335,0.0,2.29865

It is small and inconspicuous, which is nice, and makes it less likely someone will try to grab it.<br /><br />It was easy to get it connected and start working and it worked just fine. I find this a useful way to monitor your biking performance and see how you improve over time. No, it doesn't quite have all the different features some similar products have, but it doesn't say it does. I was happy with it and would recommend it.",0.9752,158,19.75,0.0,2.29256
"Whether the Rip Deck system is going to truly help your exercise routine depends on you. This is a very solid piece of machinery... it feels like a quality piece.

It can also give you more variety than a simple push up and may help you stay in a better position. Now of course you really don't need any machine to work out these muscles; there are plenty of floor exercises that can work the same muscles and don't cost anything, take up any room, etc. Still, many people find this can help them get more bang for the buck, or you might feel like it makes your workout more interesting or varied.

I've been wanting a hat that would keep the gnats and bugs out of my face while I'm working outside.  I picked this one because you can securely tuck the netting up out of the way when you don't need it and still have a sun hat. The brim probably needs to be a bit larger to keep the netting further out from touching your face.  The netting material definitely clouds your view/vision especially when there are folds in the netting put that's a small price to pay not to have to keep waving away the gnats.

"It was so hard to make the decision to spend this amount of money on an ebike, but this was my one big purchase that I allowed myself this year and I just needed to share my experience!<br /><br />I'm not an avid cyclist but I do live just a couple of miles from the beach.  Between me and the beach is a large hill that is hard to go up on a regular bike.  Thinking about it, I usually talk myself out of riding my bike to the beach and ride along the ocean.  I decided it was time to change that and made my decision.<br /><br />The Heybike Sola Electric Bike has the classic aesthetics of a single-gear beach cruiser with its wide seat and curved crossbar.  The brown seat and handles nicely highlight the matte black paint job of the bike.  Overall, this is a sleek looking bike.<br /><br />Installation was a little tricky because all of the electronics are already connected to the handlebars so it took a bit of manipulation to get all of the wires organized and the handlebars installed, but by following the clear instructions, I was able to assemble it within 1 hour.<br /><br />So as a bike, before turning on the electronics, it has seven gears with a nice gear shift system.  It also has disc brakes which took a bit of adjustment so as not to rub against the brake pads while riding, but once adjusted, the bike was quite and the ride was smooth.<br /><br />Turn on the electronics and the bike transforms into a beast.  The electric hub motor is designed to assist your peddling so your existing skills carry over easily.  You're not manipulating a throttle to go faster but you're actually peddling faster in order to speed up and using the brakes to slow down.  Unfortunately, I haven't found that this bike has regen braking.<br /><br />Anyway, this bike is such a classic right out of the box and the riding experience is pretty great.  I'm able to get up that hill between my house and the beach much more easily now and I will be spending more time riding along the ocean.  This is a great bike!",0.9878,443,36.91666666666666,0.5,2.4463399999999997

"[[VIDEOID:e52b122e35afdef3285852384fbbd625]] In addition to the obvious reason as to why one might need these MewaMa Electric Rechargeable Winter Gloves, there's actually another reason that's very compelling for me as to why these heated gloves are so good.<br /><br />My kids play piano and in the winter, our house can never seem to stay warm enough to keep our fingers from getting cold.  The kids have a hard time getting started with practice because they need to take a little time to warm up their hands.  While those other hand warmers you see are pretty nice, they only really heat one side of your hand.  That's where these mittens really shine.<br /><br />These MewaMa mittens have heating elements in the palm as well as at the back of the hand all the way to the fingers.  They are easy to operate as they come with two batteries that plug in using a barrel connector near the inner wrist in a pocket.  At the back of the wrist, press and hold the logo to turn the gloves on.  An led lights to let you know that the heating function is on.<br /><br />It takes about 10 seconds to get up to temperature and just like regular gloves, the enclosed space will hold the heat in and eventually, your own body heat will help to keep your hands warm.<br /><br />In terms of this product as a glove, the material is wind proof and is lined with fleece on the inside.  There is a strap to tighten the gloves near the wrist to lock in the heat and keep any snow out, and they also have wrist straps so that you won't lose the gloves when you take them off.<br /><br />My daughter has used it for a few days now, perhaps an hour at a time and the batteries have not run out yet.  She loves them.  Even when studying and not playing piano, she just wants to keep her hands warm.",0.9889,395,39.5,0.1,2.3266699999999996
"This ab roller wheel is a very simple product.  It's a wheel with a grippy surface with a metal tube going through it and foam grips for comfort.  Yet, when I first put it together, I managed to do it wrong...  my fault.<br /><br />I pushed the foam grips as hard as I could together until they couldn't go any further, yet, I still had maybe 3 inches of metal pipe showing, meaning that the wheel turned well, but it had a lot of leeway to go sideways.  I used it like that for a few days until I realized that it wasn't right.  I tilted the whole thing on its side and used the floor as leverage to push the grips all the way in.  Finally, I had a secure wheel that wouldn't roll to the left or right.<br /><br />Anyway, Ab rollers are an underrated piece of exercise equipment.  That's probably because it is very important to use proper posture and technique or you may end up hurting your back.  Please check out some youtube videos for proper usage.  I do this exercise on my knees and try to keep my back slightly arched and my hips thrusted toward my abs.  Pushing out is easy enough.  Keep the back arched and stretch as far as I can, then on the way back, concentrate on using the abs to pull you in rather than bending your legs.<br /><br />Overall, good build and the rounded shape helps to do the more advanced movement where you roll out to the sides to work on obliques.",0.9701,313,28.454545454545453,0.1,1.92103
"The purpose of push up bars are to give you a full range of motion throughout your exercise.  When doing a bench press, you can bring the bar all the way down to your chest, which is a good range of motion.  Doing a regular push up on the floor, it's not as easy to get that range.  That is unless you have these pushup bars.<br /><br />They are very simple pieces of equipment.  Easy to assemble:  Connect the horizontal legs to the bars and you're done.  They are also easy to use.  Place them farther apart or closer to work on the different parts of the chest.  This is the freedom that separate bars give you as opposed to a push up board with fixed positions.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these bars are not horizontal.  I suppose that it is supposed to make them more ergonomic but I found that it was uncomfortable to bend my wrist at those angles, especially when doing decline/incline push ups or wide push ups.<br /><br />I still use them daily and find them to be acceptable.",0.5569,219,24.33333333333333,0.1,1.3970700000000003

I'm able to deploy it within 30 seconds and with the hooks and rubber footing underneath, the seat should stay put on the bench.<br /><br />It will take some time to tell whether the joints will be the weak point for this chair but so far, I've been using it for a couple of months now and the joints haven't failed on me.",0.8382,197,49.25,0.1,2.2814599999999996

"The concept of this pullup bar is great.

The rope is easily adjusted and easily switched out with the weighted balls for indoor use.  The electronic counter helps to keep track of number of jumps, total time, and calories burned.<br /><br />These are all great features that one would want in a modern rope.  Unfortunately, the all-plastic build means that the handles themselves are quite light and the thin rope doesn't add a lot of weight.  The weighted balls are also not quite weighted enough.  The light weight allows for faster jumping but not great if you're looking to train your arms while jumping.<br /><br />This rope is inexpensive and easy to use, but I find myself going back to the more traditional, more weighted rope due to feeling that the Kica just seems to be less sturdy and a little too light.",0.769,186,26.571428571428573,0.0,1.4307
"The Apollo Walker Camping Chairs Folding Portable Beach Chairs are quite durable.  The nylon fabric on this chair is quite thick when compared to the cheaper chairs that I purchased to use at my kids' sports events.  The main chair has a reclining feature and the foot stool/chair is made just as well.<br /><br />The concept for this chair is that you can lean back and put your feet up on the foot stool.  When necessary, the stool can be used as a separate chair.  They do work as intended as you can see from the pictures, what you see is what you get.<br /><br />What you can't tell from the pictures is that because of the thicker nylon and the fact that there are two chairs, this is a fairly heavy product.  The chairs are joined together with a clamping system, which means they aren't as easy to separate as a system that can clip the two together.  Also because of the two chairs, they are awkward to fold together and compress small enough to fit back into the bag easily.<br /><br />So the concept is quite good but when actually using it, you'll find that these chairs do require a little more work and have to deal with the extra weight...  that's on top of all the other stuff you're already carrying when you go to sports events or picnics.",0.4667,273,39.0,0.1,1.3700100000000002
"This racket is a step up from the $20 rackets that one can purchase from Target, but being a beginner, I'm uncertain how heavily my review should weigh on your decision to purchase this racket.<br /><br />Compared to the cheaper racket that I previously purchased, it is slightly heavier but it seems to be of a more rugged build.  The sides are well reinforced and the string is well strung.  The grip is nicely cushioned and the racket is very aerodynamic; it is almost silent, lacking the whipping sound when swinging the racket.  The included bag and vibration dampener are also welcome.<br /><br />I hope to use this racket to learn Tennis and I believe this racquet will serve me well.",0.9161,146,36.5,0.1,1.9048300000000002
"GS CHIER Tennis Trainer Rebound Ball Portable Training Tool consists of a rubber puck attached to a tennis ball.  The intent is that the ball will always come back to the player to aid in hitting practice.  In general, the device works as in tended.<br /><br />The puck is heavy enough and grippy enough to stay in place when the ball is hit and it does get pulled back.  Unfortunately, the elastic line gets tangled and affects the bounce of the ball.  For a beginner, more time might be spent dealing with the line than practicing.  It makes one wonder whether this device is any better than hitting the ball against a wall when practicing solo.  For serving and hitting, a bucket of balls will do quite well and for hitting practice, a racketball wall is probably a better choice.",0.6997,159,22.714285714285715,0.0,1.00991
"[[VIDEOID:83c958ef59934ea5cf190154e38a240d]] I've had a compact stepper for a couple of years now.  It's the perfect solution for my lifestyle.  I don't have a lot of room for an exercise bike or elliptical but I still needed something that helped me get my exercise.  I use the compact stepper while watching TV.  It's quiet enough, but does have a slight squeak.<br /><br />When I saw the L NOW Adjustable Mini Stair Stepper, I thought the design looked promising and it looked more compact.  I gotta say, it works well, and so far, it's been pretty quiet.  It has a step counter built in but no resistance adjustment.  Still, the resistance for my 145lb frame is comparable to my original stepper set at about medium to high resistance, which is my normal setting anyway.  The L Now is more compact and lighter, making it even easier to store away when I don't need it.  After a 20 minute session, I work up quite a sweat.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and I've taken a couple of pictures and videos to compare the two machines side-by-side to help you make your own decision.  I think my original stepper sold pretty well and I expect the L Now stepper to do well also.",0.9953,259,23.545454545454547,6.1,4.12859
"This is a simple product.  Nylon strap with a quick release clip, but in actual use, the hole in the ring is too big.

"My wife recommended this stepper to many of our friends and relatives and Sunny Health has sold 5 steppers because of her.  You're welcome Sunny Health and Fitness.<br /><br />Features:<br /> - Good build quality<br /> - Small footprint<br /> - Affordable price<br /> - Step/calories counter<br /> - Resistance bands for arm exercises.<br /> - &#34;Twist&#34; movement.<br /><br />Observations:<br /> - The resistance of the stepper seems to be a little low but after a 20 minutes, you still get a good workout.<br /> - The axis of the steps are not horizontal but at an angle.  This gives a longer stride for each step than if the axis was horizontal.  Not as long as the big machines, of course.<br /> - Quiet.  You can use this while watching TV.  I'm sure many will agree that not thinking about the exercise is the best way to exercise -- at home, at least.<br /> - Small.  This means you can do your exercises in the living room instead of your bedroom.  Many people put their big machines in their bedroom because it can be an eye sore and you may agree that having to retire to the bedroom to exercise takes away some motivation.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br />For me, the key to consistent exercising is to find something you're willing to do.  Having to hide away to your bedroom, having your head bobbing up and down (a la treadmills), and not being able to hear the TV while doing your exercises are all things that eventually make one dread having to do their exercises.<br /><br />The reason my wife is able to convince others to buy the Sunny Health & Fitness Twister Stepper is that it does not intrude into your everyday routines so it is easy to keep up with.  With that kind of consistency, you're sure to see some results.<br /><br />NOTE:<br />After the first week, the stepper had a bad squeaking sound.  It seemed to be that a piece of metal got in the way of the air outlet for the piston, making it whistle.  During a rigorous step session, I managed dislodge the obstruction and the unit has been quiet since.  If you're having the same problem, you can try &#34;running up the stairs&#34; for a while.  I can't say that this will work for everyone, but hopefully, Sunny Health can either fix their manufacturing process or help to replace those who had the same problem.",0.9817,537,38.35714285714285,0.2,2.35451

These balls are so light they barely stay on a tee in a light breeze. They have no weight to them so it encourages overswinging. Not good for practice.,-0.1098,32,10.666666666666666,0.0,0.7670600000000001
Nice kit for a beginner golfer or one like me that needed to replace some things that were worn out.  Excellent ball brush with a retractable clip. Tees are kind of short and not very useful except maybe on the range. Ball bag and towels.  Nice folding divot tool with a magnetic ball marker. This would be an awesome stocking stuffer for the golfer in your life.,0.9017,73,12.166666666666666,0.0,2.27051
"First off let me say I have played golf for over 30 years. I have never had a folding divot tool so opening and closing this was not intuitive.

Once I figured it out  I got them on but they are truly large sized and way too bog for my shoes . Because of this I  wasn't able to walk around in them.

"I've been wanting one of these for a long time to add to my prepper box. This particular product isn't as great as I had hoped. It takes a lot of pressure to get a spark so be aware that you will have to really strike hard. I'm not that thrilled either with the ""striker"" part of this that is embedded in cheap plastic and will not really hold up too well.  The other issue is that in order to keep the striker with the ferro rod, you have to try to feed a ball chain that is attached to the striker through a tiny hole in the rod.  Not great for durability and ease of use.",-0.6773,129,21.5,0.0,0.9968100000000002

Because of the way this is constructed, I can see the dividers coming lose over time and allowing a co mingling of your balls, tees and markers. Should be good for awhile.

"I am really impressed with this game. I set it up on the concrete floor in my barn and  played back and forth with myself.

I found this product to be very poorly made. Both of the back legs cracked when I was putting them on. The felt is poorly attached and the whole thing not worth much.

So I guess it really is a &#34;multi tool&#34; since so many varied professions can use it. Knife is very sharp.

"This arrived today and I was very anxious to try to set it up. We camped a lot when I was a child and setting up the tent always involved a lot of cussing on someone's part. This wasn't too different an experience in some ways.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Fairly easy to set up the first time out of the box. I did it by myself.<br />Lightweight enough for a woman to carry<br />Large floor space and tall enough for a 6' 2&#34; man to stand up in.<br />Lots of vents and windows<br />Nice rainfly<br /><br />Cons:<br />Impossible directions. You don't need them too much to get set up, but you need some guidance to get the tent down and back in the bag. It took 3 tries to finally get it in there<br />The center beam on the top that keeps the tent stretched out, did not lock in place for us. I don't know if this is a defect or just poor design<br />Because of the lightweight nature of this, the floor and walls are very thin material. The floor reminds me of one of those really cheap plastic tarps that you can get.<br />The metal stakes that are used to hold in the feet of the poles bend very easily if you hit a rock or an obstacle.<br />Not very secure when set up. I think this would need some serious tent stakes to hold it down in any kind of wind. It was windy here today and I'm not sure this would have stayed together too long.<br />The zippers are not going to take much use, in fact the whole thing might be good for one season of regular camping and use/abuse.<br /><br />All in all, I was hoping for better. At least something that kids visiting us could use. Maybe with a little tweaking we can get it stable.",0.845,411,34.25,0.0,1.4535000000000002
"This is a really fabulous set of Bocce Balls. The box was so heavy the UPS guy actually carried it to the door for a change.  Haven't played in years, but we are looking forward to trying these out as soon as the yard dries out again. My only complaint would be the carrying case that comes with these. It is completely soft sided with no support. The balls themselves are packed inside a ratty box that fits inside the case for storage. The box has seen better days on the slow boat from China. I would have given 5 stars if they could build the black case better and eliminate the interior box.",0.5915,124,15.5,0.0,1.77745

"I had high hopes for this. Boy was I disappointed.<br /><br />First it is very small as in short and narrow. I don't know too many adults that could sit on this. Maybe a swimsuit model, but not a regular person.<br /><br />Secondly, it is fairly difficult to put together by yourself. My husband and I struggled to get it together and I would not have been able to do it by myself. There is a lot of tension on the frame when you are inserting it into the fabric.  Because of this, I don't see the average person taking this apart every time and rolling it back up.<br /><br />No way it could be table. Way to small. After you sit on it, the fabric stretches out and there isn't anywhere that is level enough to use.<br /><br />Gonna make a nice cat bed since that is about all that will fit on it comfortably.",0.5023,201,22.33333333333333,0.0,0.95069

"Most comfortable night of camp sleeping I’ve ever had! I try to be a minimalist camper but I’m getting older and cold nights on hard ground are less appealing.

It was truly a pleasure. The foot pump took longer than I’d hoped but it was still worth it. Durable materials and not too much noise from friction with my sleeping bag. I could sidesleep without bottoming out. My husband is big man but he also thought it was comfortable and, most importantly, he didn’t pop it. I can’t backpack with it but that’s okay.

"I purchased this pad last week based solely on the positive reviews. If you've spent any time looking at camping equipment on Amazon, you know that many products and their reviews are suspicious. Not here -- this one is the real deal! I just returned from a backpacking trip where it performed so well that I had to immediately write this review even though I just got home, I'm sore, and I'm exhausted.<br /><br />First, the size: A third of the size of the lightest pad from the most well-known manufacturer, (and this one is full body, not just torso like their ultra lightweight). Long enough for me 5'9&#34; and my pillow with room to spare.<br /><br />The quality: Perfectly made, no trouble with the valve or any parts of the pad, no strong odor right out of the package. The material feels so lightweight that I was nervous about popping it but I used it in a tent and directly on a beach for sunbathing and had no issues. I also took a nap on it directly on the hardwood floor in my home to test it for leaks and was very comfortable.<br /><br />The support: I have tried any number of pads for car camping and backpacking over the years and this was by far the most supportive and comfortable for me. Because of the number of chambers, you will bottom out on this one if you don't have all of your weight on it like if you're sitting upright on it or kneeling on it in your tent or whatever. But, if you're resting flat on the pad it is wonderfully supportive. I'm not a small person and I had no issues with getting a comfortable rest on this pad in any direction - back, side, or belly sleeping.<br /><br />The functionality: It is very easy to inflate, took me exactly 12 breaths each time. It's easy to close the valve without air escaping. It's wasn't unreasonably loud against my tent or sleeping bag. The texture of the material was good for holding my pillow in place and I didn't slide off it in my taffeta sleeping bag. It was very easy to roll it up and get it back in it's carrying sack. It never went back in as compactly as it arrived but it was close enough (see photos).<br /><br />I'm thrilled with this purchase and I'm looking forward to many more backpacking excursions with this trusty pad.

It weighs over 16 pounds which is significantly more than most similar chairs but this is due to the incredible materials used in its creation.  This makes it an ideal chair for areas where you won’t have to hike a great distance to reach.<br /><br />We have tested this chair on multiple adventures over the last several months and besides the weight we have been nothing but impressed with this incredibly comfortable, well built chair.",0.9807,246,82.0,0.0,1.8942100000000002

I could not believe just how easy it was to clear this snorkel after diving under water - absolutely remarkable.<br /><br />I was glad that I opted for the S/M as I’m certain the larger size would have leaked on me.  The tri point head gear allows for adequate adjustments which allowed me to make the mask snug and comfortable and not leak.<br /><br />The most impressive thing about this mask is how clearly you can see under water which is the whole point of wearing a mask in the first place.  While most masks limit your vision to a narrow field directly in front of you this is so much more open.  You really have to experience this to appreciate just how different it really is.<br /><br />I have LOVED this mask and have recommended it to several of my friends.<br /><br />This is a great product.",0.9931,248,49.6,0.0,2.29793

"This is a really cool product that once I figured out a few tricks to its use I’ve really enjoyed owning.<br /><br />It will definitely help to watch videos on tips as to the best way to fill these loungers.  If you’ve seen commercials showing people quickly swiping these through the air then sealing and sitting down - that is misleading.  There must be enough airflow to adequately fill the lounger sack so that will require either a breeze or creating one.  This can be accomplished by holding it open and running or, as I do, using a battery operated fan.<br /><br />This product is different from others in this category as it has a pillow and a light built it with it - both are nice additions.  In addition there are pouches on the side perfect for storing a drink, book, sunglasses, etc.<br /><br />I got the “Glow Galaxy” model when the rechargeable battery powered light is illuminated the lounger glows a cool deep purple color illuminating the star pattern.  During the day the light really isn’t noticeable but at night it’s incredible.  The thing I’ve found I really like about having the light is when at a festival or on the beach it’s always easy to spot my group based on where my glowing lounger in located.<br /><br />As with anything like this, air will slowly leak out - the more weight or pressure applied the faster air escapes.  If someone drops too hard down on to it more air escapes.  None of this is to be unexpected.<br /><br />Sitting upright we fit 3 of us comfortably side by side although we are all relatively small.<br /><br />While at first I wasn’t sure if I was going to figure out if I could fill this and seal it without the air escaping, now that I’ve used it for a while it’s really not a big deal.

"When I saw this Gator backpack by Franklin I was excited to get it - but now that I’ve used it I am left underwhelmed.<br /><br />The logo is EXCELLENT.  The modern Albert head logo embroidered on a royal blue field circled in orange - affixed permanently to the heather grey shell outer fabric of the backpack does look great.<br /><br />Unfortunately that is about the extent of what I like about this backpack.<br /><br />The outer shell material is excessively stiff and the inner liner shell feels like cheap polyvinyl material that crinkles loudly anytime you move it.<br /><br />The overall design makes poor use of space and offers almost no built in organization methods, unlike most backpacks.<br /><br />The outer pocket, where typical backpacks have an area to hold things you need to access easily - writing utensils, keys, wallet, etc - this one opens to a large pocket that encompasses the entire front with only a small mesh divider that rises to the level of the zipper.  If you attempt to keep something there the first time the backpack is carried in any way but vertical everything in this pouch mixes within the larger front pocket.<br /><br />Each side has mesh places to hold water bottles or possibly an umbrella. Unfortunately these are made so small that while you can force a typical water bottle into it - it’s not easy.<br /><br />The main compartment has 1 divided area that is created with the crinkly material and elastic. It will hold a small laptop but the depth of this bag is so minimal that if that was in it there would be little room for anything else.<br /><br />While the ergonomically shaped straps have padding and meshed fabric for ventilation the back does not.<br /><br />The bottom of the bag has 2 zippers that open and reveal the ball hammock that extends from one pocket then buckle clips within the other with 2 plastic buckles.  I managed to use this to hold a beach towel once but for the most part I’ve found that feature a waste.<br /><br />At this price point there are vastly superior backpack options.

"When I first read the description on this item I questioned how comfortable it could be as thin as it is - but I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />When stored in the included pouch it takes up very little space making it a perfect addition to anyone’s camping gear.  I found that the bundled pouch was easy to hook to the outside of my camping pack so it took up none of the valuable interior space.<br /><br />When you’re ready to use it, preparation couldn’t be easier.  You simply unfold, unroll and shake it out a few times.  Using the corner air valve you inflate the pad.  The innovative design requires little effort or air to completely inflate.<br /><br />I’ve used, tested and reviewed several different similar products and what makes this product unique is the honeycomb air pocket cells.  While this pad is not very thick I found it was really comfortable.<br /><br />When finished using it, deflation is equally straightforward.  You’ll release the air - I found it easiest to open the valve and completely roll the pad starting at the end opposite of the valve.  Once I had the air expelled, I folded it back like it was originally and tightly rolled it back up then slid it back into the nylon sack.<br /><br />This is a high quality product that is easy to inflate / deflate and is compact for storing and carrying when you’ll use it.<br /><br />This is definitely a product I’d recommend.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

"This set of resistance bands is top of the line in regards to quality.<br /><br />Professional trainers have been utilizing resistance bands in their training methods for many years.

"[[VIDEOID:71362f66ff460ad5ee0bb210fa085b42]] This is exactly the water bottle you see professional athletes using.<br /><br />It is a high quality water bottle. In my tests it did not leak whatsoever when turned upside down when filled with water.  The cap has an ingenious valve that only allows liquid through when the bottle is squeezed.<br /><br />There is a clear viewing panel on the side so you can see how much liquid is left inside.<br /><br />It’s safe to wash on the top rack of the dishwasher.<br /><br />This is definitely a product I’d recommend.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

"If you are looking into these sets, I assume you know what the game is and how it’s played.  It is an excellent game for kids and adults alike - perfect for at home in your yard, at the beach or park.  We love playing it but are certainly not professionals.<br /><br />This starter set is ideal for most families. The balls are not too heavy - each of mine weighed in at 430g +/- 5g - so I consider that equally weighted.  This is about half the official standardized weight of Bocce Balls - but for a beginner set it’s great.<br /><br />They fit nicely in your hand and the grooves in the balls give you enough grip to be able to apply spin when you throw.<br /><br />The white Pallino Ball’s weight does not matter but is 29g and is the appropriate size.<br /><br />In our tests the balls held up well during play, throw and roll nicely. These are not intended to be a professional set in any way so I listed the weights just as a reference point for those who understand the game.<br /><br />I think this is an awesome set for families to enjoy, kids to learn, to use to travel with and the casual players. I would certainly recommend it.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

"We got this sweater for out Moyen Poodle, he has a 17.5” chest circumference so we went with the medium. The length is perfect but it is too bulky in the body and once it stretches a bit he will slip out of it.  I’m afraid the smaller size would be too tight.<br /><br />The cut of this seems like it would fit dog’s shaped like a pug better. While our Moyen Poodle has a 17.5” circumference chest it quickly narrows to his belly which is much more narrow.<br /><br />The sweater itself is well made and looks really nice.  The colors are vibrant and the stitching is excellent. There is an accent button on the back at the base of the V neck.<br /><br />While I really like this sweater the sizing is a bit hard to determine.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

"This cooler is really well made and the design is superb.<br /><br />This is the perfect cooler to carry to the beach or the pool. It has plenty of capacity and keeps your items cool all day long. It’s easy to carry even when it’s full because the straps have plenty of padding.<br /><br />The outer shell is constructed from a very high quality, heavy duty canvas material. The zippers, buckles and straps are heavy duty and reinforced.  The zipper pulls are ergonomically shaped for easy gripping and pulling.  The base has vinyl reinforcement that helps protect it when it’s placed on hard surfaces.<br /><br />This is one of those products where the manufacturer has tried to anticipate things you will need and then provide those - a bottle opener on the right strap, a place to carry a drink on both sides when carrying it as a backpack.  The front outer pocket is easy to access and has separate slots for items such as your phone or keys.<br /><br />This cooler can easily fit a case of cans with plenty of room for ice.<br /><br />This is all around an awesome cooler backpack.",0.9816,245,35.0,0.4,2.41448
This bat is the perfect size for my seven year old learning to play baseball. It’s very durable and has held up to some rough play quite well. It’s lightweight and let’s him work on his form. Overall a great bat.,0.9324,51,12.75,0.0,2.27972
Love this water bottle! The colors are really fun and the time markings make it easy to remember to drink enough water throughout the day. The straw makes it really easy to drink on the go too.,0.9346,40,13.333333333333334,0.0,2.28038

"I got this net as a gift for my 10-year-old daughter, she has recently become very interested in soccer but we cannot go out to play because of the pandemic. This net is a great option for backyards and it’s easy enough to assemble and take apart if you need to. It comes with a nice bag for storage so it’s easy to take to the park in store in the car too. So far it seems very sturdy and is working great for my daughter. It’s a nice size for older kids and adults, really makes you work on your aim.",0.9881,116,23.2,0.0,2.29643
"I got this soccer ball for my ten year old to practice with and she LOVES it. The size is perfect for her and she loves the super fun colors. I was worried about the color flaking off but so far this ball has been sturdy and we haven’t had any issues with it, even after being out in the wet grass for a few games. Looks really fun in pictures and we haven’t seen any other people with a holographic ball yet.",0.9361,92,23.0,0.0,2.28083
